Idomeyini yangaphandle kweseli ye-ACE2 ihlukaniswa ukusuka kudomeyini ye-transmembrane nge-enzyme eyaziwa ngokuthi yi-sheddase, futhi iphrotheni encibilikayo eba khona ikhishelwa egazini futhi ekugcineni iphumela emchamweni.	wiki_20:2417	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
en	zu	ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.	I-ACE2 ikhona ezakhini zomzimba eziningi: i-ACE2 ihlangene nolwelwesi lweseli ikakhulu lwamaseli ohlobo II e-alveolar, ama-enterocytes amathumbu amancane, amaseli e-arterial nawe-venous endothelial namaseli ezicubu abushelelezi e-arterial ezakhini zomzimba eziningi.	wiki_20:2418	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
en	zu	ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.	I-ACE2 mRNA itholakala naku-cerebral cortex, ku-striatum, ku-hypothalamus, naku-brainstem.	wiki_20:2419	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028

en	zu	ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).	I-ACE2 ihlukanisa i-carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine ukusuka ku-angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) bese uyihlukanisa ibe yi-vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).	wiki_20:2422	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028

en	zu	As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).	Njengephrotheni eliyi-transmembrane, i-ACE2 isebenza njengendawo yokungena eyinhloko kumaseli ama-coronavirus athile, okubandakanya i-HCoV-NL63; i-SARS-CoV (igciwane elibangela i-SARS); ne-SARS-CoV-2 (igciwane elibangela i-COVID-19).	wiki_20:2425	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
en	zu	More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.	Ngokuqondile, ukuhlangana kwephrotheni le-spike S1 ye-SARS-CoV ne-SARS-CoV2 kudomeyini eyi-enzyme ye-ACE2 ebusweni bamaseli kuphumela ku-endocytosis nakuhambeni kwakho kokubili igciwane ne-enzyme kuye ku-endosomes ephakathi kwamaseli.	wiki_20:2426	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
en	zu	This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic.This has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2, in cells, might help in fighting the infection.	Le nqubo yokungena iphinde idinge ukwenza i-S protein lenziwe lisebenze yi-serine protease TMPRSS2, isivimbeli esingaphansi kophenyo lwamanje njengesingaba yikhambi lesifo. Lokhu kuye kwaholela abathile ukuba baphethe ngokuthi ukunciphisa amaleveli e-ACE2, kumaseli, kungasiza ekulweni negciwane.	wiki_20:2427	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
