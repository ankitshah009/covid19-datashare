Coronavirus (Covid19) Guidance
ENGLISH
</p>
<p>
COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus called coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Everyone must stay at home to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
This includes people of all ages – even if you do not have any symptoms or other health conditions.
You can only leave your home:
• to shop for basic essentials – only when you really need to
• to do one form of exercise a day – such as a run, walk or cycle, alone or with other people you live with
• for any medical need – for example, to visit a pharmacy or deliver essential supplies to a vulnerable person
• to travel to and from work – but only where this is absolutely necessary
</p>
<p>
If you have:
• a high temperature – you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
• a new, continuous cough – this means you've started coughing repeatedly
you should stay at home and follow the isolation guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection.
</p>
<p>
Gatherings of more than two people in public – including religious gatherings (except for funerals) – are banned. It is important that you follow this guidance, you could be fined if you do not.
The police, immigration officers, and the army may play a role in enforcing public health measures, as well as ensuring food and other essentials are delivered to vulnerable people.
Due to the coronavirus, the requirement for reporting as a condition of immigration bail has been temporarily suspended. You will receive an SMS text message with details of your next reporting date.

</p>
<p>
Who's at high risk from coronavirus
Coronavirus can make anyone seriously ill, but there are some people who are at a higher risk.
For example, you may be at high risk from coronavirus if you:
• have had an organ transplant
• are having certain types of cancer treatment
• have blood or bone marrow cancer, such as leukaemia
• have a severe lung condition, such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma
• have a condition that makes you much more likely to get infections
• are taking medicine that weakens your immune system
• are pregnant and have a serious heart condition
</p>
<p>
If you think you fall into one of these high risk categories and you have not received a letter from your healthcare team by Sunday 29 March 2020 or been contacted by your GP (doctor), you should discuss your concerns with your GP (doctor) or hospital clinician. If you don’t have a GP, contact DOTW UK for support: 0808 1647 686 (this is a free number to call) or email clinic@doctorsoftheworld.org.uk
</p>
<p>
How to protect yourself if you're at high risk
If you're at high risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus, there are extra things you should do to avoid catching it.
These include:
• not leaving your home – you should not go out to do shopping, pick up medicine or exercise
• stay at least 2 metres (3 steps) away from other people in your home as much as possible
Ask friends, family or neighbours to pick up shopping and medicines for you. They should leave them outside your door.
If you need help getting deliveries of essential supplies like food, you can register to get coronavirus support.
You are strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for a period of at least 12 weeks from the day you receive your letter.
Read the full advice on protecting yourself if you're at high risk from coronavirus on GOV.UK.
