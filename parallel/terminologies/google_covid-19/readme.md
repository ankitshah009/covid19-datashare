File Format
Language and Locale Format
We use BCP-47 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) as language and locale code format, conforming to casing specs (https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-3.1.4) and will use hyphen to indicate locales or scripts.  

We use two letter language code in most cases except for:

es-419, es-ES
fr-FR, fr-CA
pt-BR, pt-PT
zh-CN, zh-TW, zh-HK

File Format
CSV files with BCP-47 standard with following headers: 
stringID | sourceLang | targetLang | pos | description | sourceString | targetString 

Files are encoded in UTF-8.

pos tags will follow the spelled out pos names in POS Universal tags: https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/


File Naming Convention
sourceLang_targetLang
The file name should be all lower case. Example: en_af, en_pt-br

Tracking changes
After the initial batch of term commits, we will use the index.csv file to track the following file change status:

Draft (the terms have been translated by professional translators but havenâ€™t been independently reviewed) or Revised
Additional languages are being committed
Additional source terms are being added
Additional translations are being added

index.csv file has headers: file_name | status 

Example: 
en_af.csv | Draft
en_ms.csv | Revised
