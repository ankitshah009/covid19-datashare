<s sent_id='3138' desc='CDC'>Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that is a rare cause of illness in the United States. Infection with V. vulnificus is a serious health threat that predominantly affects persons with an underlying illness or a compromised immune system, and especially affects persons with liver disease. The organism is a natural inhabitant of warm coastal waters. Persons who develop wound infections generally do so following contamination of a pre-existing wound or through an injury acquired while exposed to warm coastal waters where the V. vulnificus organism is growing.

•Culture of wound or hemorrhagic bullae is recommended, and all V. vulnificus isolates should be forwarded to a public health laboratory
•Blood cultures are recommended if the patient is febrile, has hemorrhagic bullae, or has any signs of sepsis
•Antibiotic therapy:
•Doxycycline (100mg PO/IV twice a day for 7-14 days) and a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g.,ceftazidime 1-2g IV/IM every eight hours) is generally recommended
•A single agent regimen with a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin, has been reported to be at least as effective in an animal model as combination drug regimens with doxycycline and a cephalosporin
•Children, in whom doxycycline and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, can be treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus an aminoglycoside
