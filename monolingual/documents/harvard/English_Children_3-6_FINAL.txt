Why is school closed?
There’s a germ called Coronavirus that can make people sick.
We want people to stay healthy!
Why can’t I visit or hug my grandparents and friends?
Grandma and Grandpa are older and we don’t want them to get sick.
You can visit your grandparents and friends soon when the germ goes away.
For now, we can call and video chat with them!
What if I’m worried about me or my family getting sick?
It’s normal to have worries. 
First, talk to an adult.
Try taking five slow, deep breaths to help your body feel calm and safe.
Next, find something fun to do instead of worrying!
What can I do to be a germbuster?
The germ likes to live on things we touch. 
Wash your hands with soap and count to 20 to make the germ go away!
If you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with your elbow!
Remember, there are lots of grownups here to help!
Hey parents and caretakers!
Be sure you and your children are practicing proper hand-washing technique and stay home as much as possible. 
Ask your child what they know about the virus. 
Reassure them and answer questions at an age-appropriate level.
Monitor yourself and your children for any signs of COVID-19 and seek the guidance of a healthcare provider.
