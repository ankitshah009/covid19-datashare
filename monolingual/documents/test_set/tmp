Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
Coronaviruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface projections.
Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or a secondary bacterial bronchitis).
Coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and sore throat from swollen adenoids, occurring primarily in the winter and early spring seasons.
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the early 1970s.
Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds.
Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor.

Hand Hygiene – World Health Organization "WHO"
Hand washing
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
Hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water.

If a group of passengers is connecting from an area with a severe outbreak, the flight attendants may be able to seat them away from the rest of the passengers (and if you were recently in a high-risk area, consider telling the flight attendants for this reason).
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.

It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
It appears that bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are ideal hosts for the coronavirus gene source (with bats for alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, and birds for gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus) to fuel coronavirus evolution and dissemination.Bovine coronavirus and canine respiratory coronaviruses diverged from a common ancestor recently (~ 1950).
It appears that the virus is spread through respiratory droplets from a person's coughs and sneezes in a range of approx. 6 feet (1.80 meters).
It cannot be assumed that those with missing information are similar to those with data on either hospitalizations or underlying health conditions.

It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.

It is a key part of Regulation 12 about safe care and treatment, periodically inspected by the Care Quality Commission.
It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
It is anticipated that great efficiencies in project management will result through this collaboration than that obtained from countries acting alone.

It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand.
It is en route for Melbourne.
It is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.
It is hoped that it can return results in 15 minutes by detecting both IgM and IgG antibodies.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.
It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear.
It is not certain whether the infections are the result of a single zoonotic event with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or if the multiple geographic sites of infection represent multiple zoonotic events from an unknown common source.
It is not yet known whether the severity or level of control of underlying health conditions affects the risk for severe disease associated with COVID-19.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
It is plausible that enhanced coding of information from contacts with the practices in RCGP RSC will reduce the likelihood of people who may be suspected COVID-19 cases being brought to the surgery inadvertently.
It is possible for silent MERS to occur, this is when the patient does not develop symptoms.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
It is primarily spread between people via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes.
It is still common to refer the disease as "Wuhan pneumonia" or "Chinese virus" in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan.
It is still unknown if temperatures above 56 °C can kill SARS-CoV 2.
It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.Like the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B).
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
It is unclear if these cases are the result of reinfection, relapse, or testing error.Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.

It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health labs through the International Reagent Resource.

Pathology
Patient zero is the term used to describe the first-ever case of a disease.
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore-throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.
Patients who attend their practice for a routine blood test will be asked to provide an additional sample for serology.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
SARS-CoV-2 has been "community-spreading" in the United States undetected for weeks, and new vaccine development may require a minimum of a year to prove safety and efficacy to gain regulatory approval.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses.With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
SARS-CoV-2 may also use basigin to gain cell entry.Initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 produces at least three virulence factors that promote shedding of new virions from host cells and inhibit immune response.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on 4 February 2020 to have spread within Diamond Princess during cruise M003, which had departed on 20 January 2020 from Yokohama (in Tokyo Bay near Tokyo) for a round trip.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 1 December 2019 as the cause of what would later be named COVID-19.

Such an approach has been demonstrated to work effectively on the ASPREN surveillance data, a network of sentinel GPs and nurse practitioners who report deidentified information on ILIs and other conditions, where issues such as missing data and the need to model the observation process itself has been successfully addressed.
Such companies include Banco de Oro, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Cignal TV, EastWest Bank, Globe Telecom, Manila Water, Manulife, Maynilad Water Services, Meralco, PLDT, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Smart Communications, Security Bank, Sky Cable, Sun Cellular, Sun Life Financial, and the Union Bank of the Philippines.The Alliance Global Group pledged to donate 1,000,000 litres (260,000 US gal) of disinfectant solutions, denatured from 850,000 litres (220,000 US gal) of 96% ethyl alcohol, to local health facilities and other frontline institutions through the DOH.
Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.To 'scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails.
Such move was supported by Senators Ralph Recto, Bong Go, Risa Hontiveros, and Francis Pangilinan.
Such posts stated that their place of residence during their stay in Wuhan was also close to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first known cluster of cases occurred.In March 2020, this conspiracy theory was endorsed by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.
Such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease transmission modelling.

Suppression can be preferred but need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (at least 18 months later) as transmission quickly rebounds when relaxed, while long-term intervention causes social and economic costs.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing and coughing.

Testing
Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government.
Testing for the virus usually consists of a swab inserted through the nose or a throat swab which is analysed in a laboratory for the virus.

The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
The disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.

The impact on the cruise line industry was at a level never seen before.
The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.
The importance of hand washing for human health – particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
The incident has sparked outrage among Egyptians after the video was uploaded.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to fourteen days.

The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
The medical workers are concerned that the shortages have not been addressed by the CDC, whose changing guidance for healthcare over how to stay safe themselves and protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.

The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers, but not the general public.
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.
The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.One difficulty with vaccine development is that older people, who are more vulnerable to the disease, are often poorly vaccinated due to age-related degradation of the thymus.

The video's claim of 90,000 infected cases is noted to be 'unsubstantiated'.
The viewers had to touch the television screen to receive the spiritual healing.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment.
The virion then releases RNA into the cell, forcing the cell to produce copies of the virus that are disseminated to infect more cells.
The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
The virus MERS-CoV is a new member of the beta group of coronavirus, Betacoronavirus, lineage C.
The virus appears to have originated in bats.
The virus can last on some surfaces for several days.
The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken.
The virus causing COVID 19 spreads easily and is more likely to cause severe symptoms and death. 
The virus grows readily on Vero cells and LLC-MK2 cells.The receptor for this virus is CD26 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4).
The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.
The virus has also been found in faeces, and transmission through faeces is being researched.The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme ACE2, which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus has been found in the faeces of as many as 53% of hospitalised people and more anal swab positives have been found than oral swab positives in the later stages of infection.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The virus is in the coronavirus family and is unrelated to rabies.
The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and through objects.
The virus itself has been isolated from a bat.
The virus remained alive in aerosols throughout the time of the experiment (3 h).
The virus subsequently spread to all provinces of China and to more than one hundred other countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.The earliest person with symptoms was traced back to 1 December 2019, someone who did not have connections with the later cluster linked to the wet market.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
The virus was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, in December 2019 and is thought to be first transmitted by possibly a bat as well, but it is now spreading from person to person.
The virus was initially referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.
The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
The viruses appear to have spread from camels to humans in the early 2010s.

These virology sampling practices are also recruited to be nationally representative (Figure 1).
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst RNA viruses were termed “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope.
These were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these kinds of animals; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin.A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
These were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, consequently the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.During the early stages, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.

They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
They noted that when teachers in Israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999–2000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all. 
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
They suggested genuflection or bowing as an alternative to the practice.On March 9, 2020, Manila Apostolic Administrator, Broderick Pabillo, issued a pastoral letter advising practitioners and clergy members experiencing flu-like symptoms to refrain from attending Mass or visiting churches, recommending them to watch Masses through television or online streaming instead.
They thought that no one can challenge them, but Allah the most powerful punished them."
They use fake domains such as "cdc-gov.org" instead of the correct "cdc.gov", or even spoof the original domain so it looks real.

Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
Third, because of the limited availability of testing in many jurisdictions during this period, this analysis is likely biased toward more severe cases, and findings might change as testing becomes more widespread.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
Thirteen cases have been repatriated from the Grand Princess cruise ship.
Thirty-five Australian passengers were transferred to an Australian flight, while the remaining 157 passengers were quarantined in a military facility at Whangaparaoa for 14 days.

This infection is caused by a new coronavirus that was first seen in Wuhan, China.
This intermediary animal—not yet identified—passed it on to its first human host in the city of Wuhan in late November or early December 2019".The Inverse reported that "Christopher Bouzy, the founder of Bot Sentinel, did a Twitter analysis for Inverse and found [online] bots and trollbots are making an array of false claims.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
This involves enough people getting infected, upon which they develop immunity to the disease.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world. 
This is a nonvaccine method of immunization.
This is a partial list (by A-Z) of major businesses and government offices in California with  temporary cancellation or closure.
This is a real concern if you're trying to get out of an affected area.
This is a stressful time for many, especially those who are pregnant. 
This is based on coding described in Table 4.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.
This is especially important for those who work with persons with underlying conditions or who otherwise are at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.
This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources.
This is especially true of protracted closures.Schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction.
This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA.
This is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs.The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses.
This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002–2004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known civet coronavirus.
This is not just to protect you, but also those you come in contact with.
This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
This is similar to the measure typical of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

This means minimising contact with others by keeping a distance of six feet or two meters from them and avoiding gathering together in groups.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).
This means that each infection from the virus is expected to result in 1.4 to 3.9 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken.
This means that many medical professionals are not at the facilities where they are most needed during a health crisis.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities whose members have not travelled to areas with widespread transmission.Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions with eye protection.Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members don't know where or how they were infected.Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at its minimal scale in Wuhan.
This might also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future spillovers.
This misinformation was then spread via the social media accounts of the same media outlets, and while some outlets later removed the map, the BBC reported that a number of news sites had yet to retract the map.
This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.
This needs to be carefully coordinated nationally across the network and may require PHE to ensure individuals are not contacted by multiple agencies.
This part of the analysis was limited to persons aged ≥19 years because of the small sample size of cases in children with reported underlying health conditions (N = 32).
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over. 
This pilot was in collaboration with the PHE Seroepidemiology Unit and added to the residual blood samples submitted to PHE by National Health Service (NHS) laboratories.
This policy aims to reduce contact rates in the population and thereby reduce transmission of the virus.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
This process may include checking pseudonymized NHS numbers for positive individuals at RCGP RSC practices, checking current PHE guidance regarding considerations of infectiousness for confirmed cases, and offering the patient an appointment following the previously mentioned process.
This prompted several local and international artists to either cancel or postpone their scheduled concerts, including 98 Degrees, Ogie Alcasid and Ian Veneracion, Green Day, Hyukoh, Jimmy Eat World, Khalid, Avril Lavigne, Alanis Morissette, One Ok Rock, the fan meet of the Running Man cast, Slipknot, Gary Valenciano, and the Wanderland Music and Arts Festival.Local television networks has temporarily stopped admitting live audience for their television shows, including variety shows Eat Bulaga!

This test is specific and is designed to only detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the whole organization. 
This translates to only one in three cases coming into the UK being detected.
This tropism is unique in that most respiratory viruses target ciliated cells.Due to the clinical similarity between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it was proposed that they may use the same cellular receptor; the exopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries.
This virus is closely related to the Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," urging that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst of it".

This was despite a markedly lower daily increase in cases.
This was followed the next day by a recommended self-quarantine of all travellers from outside the country, with the exception of health care workers.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.
This was later overturned, but the delay meant that some people missed the flight.
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).
This was the first time in the biennial event’s history that it had been cancelled.
This was the first time that Anzac Day services have not been held since 1916.On 19 March, the government required the cancellation of mass indoor events with more than 100 people.
This was then followed by many universities in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba voluntarily cancelling classes and moving online.
This was through a combination of drive-through capability, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).

This would be the second postponement of the games; initially postponed to March due to non-COVID-19 related concerns.
This, combined with decreased ticket sales as a result of the outbreak, caused the airline to stop ticket sales on 4 March 2020.
This, however, varies based on the humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Those allowed in would have to self-quarantine for 14 days.The government has announced a coronavirus relief package of $13.2 million.
Those directives are consistent with the March 19, 2020, Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response, found at: https://covid19.ca.gov/. 
Those directives follow:
Those most at risk of COVID-19 infection and serious complications are the elderly and those with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.

Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spreading of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
Through this surveillance, we intend to find out more about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in ambulatory care.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
Throw him out!."
Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, it is much more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Thus, they concluded the screenshot was digitally fabricated.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).
Tim Hortons simultaneously altered its popular "Roll up the Rim to Win" promotion to a digital-only model (the chain had already announced its intent to increase its use of digital components for the promotion in an effort to combat litter).
Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between two and 14 days, with an average of five days.
Time magazine and BBC News concluded that the reason for the high number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in South Korea is thanks to the relative "openness" and "transparency" in the Korean society.

Transfers from town to town are prohibited unless you can demonstrate a valid reason.
Transmission
Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed.
Transmission from objects can happen, for example, if someone sneezes, touches a doorknob, and then other people touch the doorknob and then touch their faces.
Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in).
Transmission via the fecal–oral route may also be possible.
Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
Transportation from long-distance passenger flights to local buses has been curtailed or completely shut down in many countries due to low demand or government orders.

Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Whereas most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spreads to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
