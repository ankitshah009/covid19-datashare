Ebola Fears Slowing Tourist Flow to Africa
JOHANNESBURG —
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is putting off thousands of tourists who had planned trips to Africa this year, especially Asians, including to destinations thousands of miles from the nearest infected community such as Kenya and South Africa.
Ebola, a hemorrhagic disease which can kill up to 90 percent of those it infects, has claimed more than 1,300 lives this year in the three small West African states of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and also has a toehold in Nigeria.
Although there are no known cases outside of this epicenter, many tourists are afraid to travel anywhere on the vast continent because of concerns the disease could spread, tour operators in Africa and Asia told Reuters on Wednesday.
The bulk of the cancellations are from Asia, which has had its own share of health crises, but visitors from the United States, Brazil and Europe have also scrapped their plans or delayed trips, they said.
A Brazilian business delegation this month also canceled a trip to Namibia, in southern Africa.
"We've seen a huge amount of cancellations from Asia and the groups that do travel, the numbers have dropped," said Hannes Boshoff, managing director at Johannesburg-based ERM Tours, which organizes travel to countries in southern Africa.
He said around 80 percent of his Asian customers had cancelled trips coming up in the next two-three months, including a group booking of 1,500 Thais worth 12 million rand ($1.12 mln).
"A lot of consumers just see Africa. They see it as one country ... I try and tell people that Europe and America are closer to the Ebola outbreak than South Africa," Boshoff said.
Nearly 10 million visitors came to South Africa in 2013 and tourism accounted for more than 10 percent of GDP, with Asian markets the fastest growing, according to national statistics.
The World Health Organization declared the West African Ebola outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" on August 8, triggering global alarm as countries stepped up precautions and testing.
Intense media cover has magnified fears, although no current Ebola cases have been confirmed anywhere in the world outside Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.
Two suspected Ebola cases in South Africa this month tested negative for the disease.
The WHO has told the four countries to screen people departing at airports, seaports and major land border points and stop any with signs of the virus, but has argued against further travel restrictions. However, several airlines have canceled services to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
The disease is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected persons or animals.
Asian health fears
Travel agents said Asians, who have lived through the deadly 2002/2003 SARS epidemic and, more recently, a pandemic of H1N1 flu, do not want to take risks.
"We have dealt with a lot of guests who have literally been begged by their families to cancel their trip," said Kim Nixon, managing director at Singapore-based Asia to Africa Safaris, adding that most cancellations were trips to East Africa.
"The Asian market dealt a lot with H1N1 as well as SARS so there is a great fear of these virulent diseases no matter how easily they are spread," said Nixon, adding that 10 percent of his clients had cancelled or postponed trips.
Thompsons Africa said it had also seen the biggest cancellations from Asian clients but recently had a luxury group of U.S. travelers withdraw, which will cost the South African travel firm 500,000 rand.
"This sort of thing has momentum and it could get worse as we go into the next days and weeks," Thompsons Head of Sales Craig Drysdale said.
Simon Freemantle, a political economist at Standard Bank, noted that Africa's most advanced economy had health services better prepared to handle a crisis than most other countries on the continent even if an "imported" case were confirmed.
"But certainly it would be a very unwelcome development in light of the summer season coming up, and in our economic environment, one of the few areas that has actually been delivering some growth has been tourism," Freemantle said.
He said South Africa's tourism receipts had increased since it hosted the 2010 World Cup, a bright spot in a struggling economy that will fall short of two percent growth this year.
Besides tourism, Ebola fears are also hitting business travel and investment events in Africa, threatening the continent's image as a rising economic star.
The national tourist agency South Africa Tourism sought to reassure travelers.
"Any contagious disease will have an impact anywhere in the world, whether it was happening in Asia or in America it would have been the same thing," Thulani Nzima, chief executive of South African Tourism, told state television.
"The message is: come enjoy South Africa, it is definitely Ebola-free," he said.

WHO: Ebola Most Challenging Epidemic ‘in Decades’
WASHINGTON —
Compared to previous epidemics like SARS and Avian influenza, Ebola is probably the most challenging outbreak the world has seen in the last few decades, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security at the World Health Organization.
“[You have] a very lethal disease, placed in a setting where the health infrastructure is very weak,” said Fukuda, an American physician with expertise in influenza epidemiology.
“It’s an area where there’s a lot of cross-border movements of people. I think it’s also a situation where it’s been hard to get enough international workers and responders into the area,” he said.
Fukuda spoke Thursday in Washington, as public health experts convened a one-day conference to discuss efforts to implement the Global Health Security Agenda – a partnership among governments, international organizations and public and private stakeholders. The conference was held at George Washington University in Washington D.C.
A follow-up GHSA meeting will take place Friday at the White House, when representatives from 44 nations push to accelerate progress toward ridding the world from infectious disease threats.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs Andrew Weber said the Pentagon is delivering two laboratories to Liberia, one in Monrovia and another in Bong County that would have molecular diagnostic capabilities.
The facilities will be operated by U.S. Navy microbiologists and virologists.
While some talk about the need to send mobile BSL4 (biosafety level 4) laboratories to Liberia to help with the Ebola crisis, that’s not really what they need, Weber insisted. “They need rapid culture independent diagnostics.”
One of GHSA’s pillars is national and regional biosecurity systems, and while much of what’s being done now is individual-facility based, that’s not good enough, according to Weber.
“If the capacity that we seek to urgently [implement] the global security agenda had been in place, it’s likely the Ebola crisis would not have so severe,” said Laura Holgate, a senior official from the National Security Council.
“The reality is that Ebola has already killed four times the number of people that SARS did over a decade ago. Such a dramatic threat requires a long-term commitment as well as an urgent, immediate response," she said. “This is not a choice we make between these two styles. We must be doing them at the same time together and mindful of each other.”
Fukuda noted that while a lot has been done, much more is needed because of the short-term impact on food supply, security and general concerns about economies in the region.
But the bottom line, he explained, is that “this is a disease for which people, organizations and countries are afraid of because it’s infectious disease with a high mortality [rate].”
That fear needs to be addressed in order to get more people involved.
“We have to develop a reliable plan for international workers so they can be evacuated if needed or if health workers become sick. Getting [this agenda] firmly in place is one of those critical issues right now,” Fukuda said.
Dr. Melvin Korkor contracted Ebola while treating a nurse patient at Phebe Hospital in South-Central Liberia’s Bong County.
“I was so compassionate, I touched her without my [usual] precaution practices. So, a few days later I felt sick,” Korkor said. “I isolated myself from my family and later my lab results tested positive. I was transferred to Monrovia treatment center. Because I am a doctor and I knew what to do, I survived the virus.”
Korkor said no matter how frightening and deadly the disease is, people must have confidence in themselves in order to beat it.
“I want to tell the whole world that Ebola is real, it kills. But the good news is that it can prevented, and even if you suspect something that’s unusual, it’s better for you to seek prompt medical attention," he said.
“If you [think] you have Ebola, don’t hide yourself, don’t keep away, come to the hospital at the earliest possible [moment] and you’ll be saved,” he advised his fellow Africans.

Saudi Death Toll from MERS Virus Climbs to 102
Saudi authorities confirm 10 more deaths from the mysterious MERS virus, putting the death toll since the disease first surfaced at 102.
Eight deaths were reported Sunday after two on Saturday.
The nation's health ministry says there are now 339 confirmed cases of MERS since it was first found in Saudi Arabia two years ago.
One case also has been confirmed in Egypt, in a man who recently traveled to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi pharmacists report a run on masks, hand sanitizers and other disinfectants. Some parents are keeping their children home from school. Three hospitals in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam have been designated as special MERS treatment centers.
MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, is related to the SARS virus, which has killed more than 800 people worldwide.
But experts know little about MERS and there is no known vaccine. They are unsure how the virus is transmitted, but believe it may have originated in camels.

Scientist Who Helped Identify Ebola in 1976 Optimistic on Outbreak
LONDON —
The Ebola virus was identified in the 1970s in a tiny village in the Democratic Republic of Congo - where an intrepid team of researchers ventured to learn more. Among them was U.S.-born David Heymann, now a Professor of Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
As a young doctor with the U.S. Center for Disease Control, David Heymann witnessed the emerging threat of Ebola from its origins in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo -- then Zaire -- in 1976. The small team of international researchers took every precaution.
“The fear was so great that one of my first assignments was to go out to NASA to collect the isolation unit that had been used for the astronauts when they came off the moon,” he told VOA.
Arriving at the village of Yambuku — the center of the outbreak — Heymann and his team knew little about Ebola and named the virus after the local river.
“Ebola was considered a major threat back in 1976 because nothing was known about the virus," he said. "It was known that it was related to, or it appeared to be related to a Marburg virus, which people understood, science understood basically.”
Since then, scientists have discovered fruit bats carry the Ebola virus and pass it on to humans and other primates. Heymann says they soon realized consumption of so-called bush meat is a pathway for the disease.
“There was an outbreak in Gabon in 1996 when there were 18 hunters who killed a chimpanzee," he said. "And all 18 of them somehow, during the butchering process, became infected, took the infection home, and infected family members. But it did not spread further.”
Professor Heymann led the global response to the 2003 SARS virus outbreak in China. The disease killed more than 700 people, but was contained.
“It spread into developing countries in Asia and it was rapidly stopped there by a global effort," said Heymann. "And this was a true coordinated global effort where scientists were working together behind the scenes, exchanging information on a daily basis.”
In contrast, Heymann says early appeals for help with the current Ebola outbreak were ignored.
“There was not a robust enough response to stop it when it was still rural, and now it has spread into urban areas where it is more difficult,” he said.
There are indications that the Ebola education campaigns in West Africa are helping to halt the spread of the virus. New medicines are being fast-tracked. Professor Heymann says another area of research should also be prioritized.
“To determine how best to keep patients alive by maintaining their internal balance of electrolytes and chemicals, so that they can stay alive long enough for their own immune system to take over,” he said.
The World Health Organization says about 6,000 people have died from Ebola in West Africa since the outbreak began. Professor Heymann is optimistic the spread of the virus will have been halted by the beginning of the new year.

Gates Foundation Commits $50 Million to Fight Ebola
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says it is committing $50 million to help combat the growing Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
The Seattle-based foundation, set up by the billionaire founder of Microsoft Bill Gates to fight disease and poverty in poor countries, says it will immediately give funds to the United Nations and international aid agencies to buy badly-needed supplies and support emergency operations in affected countries.
It said it will also work with partners to speed up development of therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tests to better treat and prevent transmission of the vicious disease.
To date the foundation has already committed more than $10 million of the $50 million to fight the Ebola outbreak, including $5 million to the WHO for emergency operations and research and development assessments and $5 million to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF to support efforts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
In its statement, the foundation said it would also give an extra $2 million immediately to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support incident management, treatment, and health care system strengthening.
The foundation's pledge follows a call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for a stronger international response to the Ebola epidemic.
Also Tuesday, the United Nations allocated $3.8 million for the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service to help move aid, supplies, equipment and personnel in Ebola-struck countries. Reduced commercial travel in the region has hampered humanitarian operations there.
According to the World Health Organization, the disease has killed nearly 2,300 people this year, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
In a positive development, doctors in Senegal say the country's lone confirmed Ebola patient has recovered. The patient, a student who arrived from Guinea last month, tested negative twice for the disease.
A total of nearly 4,300 cases have been reported across West Africa since the epidemic began in February.
The WHO has warned that the number of new cases is increasing exponentially in Liberia and that thousands of new patients can be expected there over the next three weeks.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it will give $10 million to transport and equip an African Union deployment of about 100 medical workers to the region.
U.S. government contributions toward fighting the Ebola outbreak now top $100 million.

Study: Ebola Virus Stays in Semen Months After Recovery
GENEVA —
A new study finds the Ebola virus can persist in the semen of male survivors months after they recover from the deadly disease.
Ninety-three men who had been declared free of the disease participated in the study, which was conducted by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nathalie Broutet, WHO medical officer and one of the study's lead authors, told VOA that the semen of the men was tested at different stages to see how long the virus persisted.
“We found the presence of Ebola virus in the semen up to nine months," she said. "So, for these men that have positive semen, there is the risk of exposure to the virus for their sexual partners.”
Broutet said the focus of the study was on the persistence of the virus, not the risk of transmission. She said the possible sexual transmission of the virus and the magnitude of the risk would be analyzed in another study.
This study showed that the virus remains considerably longer in semen than previously thought, but that the concentration of the virus declines in the months after recovery from Ebola. It found a very high presence of the virus in the semen three months after recovery, but the concentration drops drastically after six months of survival.
Broutet said it was still not known how long it takes for the virus to disappear. Therefore, she said, WHO recommends that survivors receive support, counseling and follow-up testing. She said that in the first three months after recovery, male survivors should abstain from sex or use condoms.
Broutet said a major study to begin at the end of the month would look at the persistence of Ebola in seven body fluids among 240 male and female survivors. These include tears, sweat, vaginal secretions, semen, rectal swabs, urine and menstrual blood.

Ebola Vaccine Trials Underway in West Africa
Ebola has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people in West Africa. Since last summer, researchers have rushed to get anti-Ebola vaccines into clinical trials. While it's too early to say that any of the potential vaccines work, some scientists say they are seeing strong results from some of the studies.
It's ironic...just as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa seems to be waning, clinical trials of potential vaccines are underway there.
A vaccine candidate is currently being tested in Guinea, where the Ebola virus is still active. Those likely to get the vaccine are medical workers and people who have been exposed to the virus.
Liberia has so few new Ebola cases that a clinical vaccine trial started there may be continued in Sierra Leone or Guinea.
At Emory University in the U.S., an investigational vaccine was given to an American doctor who may have been exposed to the virus at an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone. Dr. Mark Mulligan reported the effects of the vaccine in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
“We saw strong responses from the innate immune system, the immediate responses, the first defenders in our body, and also from the subsequent antibodies and T cells that we want a vaccine to produce," said Mulligan.
The patient did not develop the Ebola virus, and he may not have been infected, but the immune response is what doctors hoped to see.
Dr. Thomas Geisbert was one of the researchers who developed this potential vaccine. Despite reports that researchers are closing in on an effective vaccine, he says there's still a lot of work to do.
"A lot of these different vaccines and treatments were developed against one species of Ebola, and a particular strain of that species, so there are five different species of Ebola virus. Three of those cause disease and morbidity, mortality in man," said Geisbert.
Dr. Geisbert says a vaccine that might work against the Zaire Ebola virus, the species circulating in west Africa, might not work against against another type of deadly Ebola virus.
But, if the vaccines are proven to work, Dr. Jesse Goodman says they could still be used in West Africa.
"It could benefit people if this outbreak went the wrong way again. And, even more importantly, these could be incredibly important tools for future outbreaks," said Goodman.
The results of the vaccine trial in Guinea could be available in July.

Liberians Worry Ebola Could Return From Guinea, Sierra Leone
MONROVIA, LOFA COUNTY, LIBERIA —
When the rate of Ebola infections in Liberia reached zero, the government decided to reopen its borders to its West African neighbors still fighting the disease.
Liberia has managed to get its outbreak under control. But many residents, especially those in northern Lofa County, which was devastated by Ebola, are concerned the deadly virus might make a comeback through visitors from neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, which are not yet Ebola free.
In the northern Liberia town of Foya, Fiyah Saah sits under a palaver hut and prepares his breakfast.
“We’re actually coping on fine because we’ve gone for more like hundred-plus days, we have not heard of any new Ebola case in Foya, in Lofa County at large," Saah said.
Residents returning
He said he is happy that the crisis is almost over. People who had fled when Ebola killed more than 40 in the district are returning. And when the nearby Sierra Leone and Guinea borders were reopened, many residents resumed their daily business as cross-border traders.
However, Saah said he and other residents fear the Ebola virus might be carried across the border and doubt the government’s surveillance measures at the borders.
“So the border has been opened. Personally, we’re very much skeptical because if you went at the borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone, we’ve not actually seen some of the protocols, some of the Ebola preventive measures been put into place," he added.
In Monrovia, Tolbert Nyenswah, the country's deputy health minister and Ebola response director, in trying to quell residents' fears, said his team will do everything to keep the country safe.
Nyenswah said he thinks the surveillance system in place is good. While risks remain, he said, his team is monitoring the situation closely and will quickly move in should a new case be recorded.
“We have not stopped meeting. Our incident management team is still [intact]. We’re still having our regular operational meeting, looking at the situation on every single day, 24/7," Nyenswah said.
He said Liberia’s health facilities have improved infection prevention controls.
Protocols in place
In Monrovia and Montserrado County, which were the Ebola epicenter of West Africa for weeks, the government still works with about 4,000 case-finders who check households on a daily basis. At the borders, health workers try to raise awareness and establish a system where citizens immediately report back to them or their community leaders in case anyone shows symptoms of Ebola.
Nyenswah said the new strategy is to follow up with people crossing the border and to actively engage people who are entering Liberia.
"In case there is an event reported, we can jump on it. So event-based and active case-finding are complementary to keep Liberians and Liberia safe of Ebola," he said.
The World Health Organization reported last week that more than 10,000 people have died of Ebola in the current outbreak in West Africa, with 4,000 of those deaths occurring in Liberia.
Nyenswah said even if Liberia is officially Ebola free, his team will remain on the watch until the situation in the neighboring countries is also solved.

New US Ebola Case Raises Fears
U.S. health officials are scrambling to respond to a new Ebola case - that of a nurse in Dallas, Texas, who cared for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last week.
America’s medical community is reviewing and tightening protocols to detect and contain the virus, as officials around the world express growing alarm about the deadly disease.
Hazardous materials workers cleaned out the apartment of a Dallas nurse, said to be in her 20s, who tested positive for Ebola. Neighbors are unnerved.
Extensive protective gear and rigorous hospital protocols designed to prevent transmission of the virus evidently failed, prompting many questions but few answers. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden cannot rule out even more cases being detected. He told CBS "Face the Nation" TV program that there was clearly "a breach in protocol."
“We know from many years of experience that it is possible to care for patients with Ebola safely without risk to health care workers," he said. "But we also know that it is hard, that even a single breach can result in contamination.”
Amid the finger-pointing, a complaint from an American nurses association. Katy Roemer says nurses are not getting the information they need to protect themselves.
“When the nurses become infected, they are blamed for not following the protocols," she said. "This is not going to work.”
Major U.S. airports have strengthened health screening procedures for passengers arriving from Africa. That may not be enough, according to Republican Congressman Michael McCaul, who does not rule out temporarily halting U.S. visas granted in parts of Africa.
“The American people are rightfully concerned," he said. "They are concerned because the Ebola virus is an unseen threat. And it is only a plane flight away from our shores."
Mounting fears extend beyond countries that have registered Ebola cases. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:
“This is a global epidemic," he said. "We are cooperating with other countries, in addition to preserving our borders.”
But panic is unwarranted and unhelpful, according to Dr. Ian Smith of the World Health Organization.
“Fear of infection has spread around the world much faster than the virus,” he cautioned.
Amid mounting anxieties, some possible good news: Russian health officials say they have developed vaccines against Ebola that are ready for testing.

In Sierra Leone, Religion Major Player in Ebola Fight
FREETOWN —
Ebola cases are continuing their downward trend in Sierra Leone. The progress is attributed in part to religious leaders who have helped by educating people in their churches and mosques.
Sierra Leone is a religious country, but what makes it somewhat unique is its religious tolerance. Muslims and Christians respect each other’s beliefs.
Now, religious leaders are taking things a step further by working together to eradicate Ebola.
In mosques and churches, the leaders are taking examples from the Bible and Quran to teach people about Ebola prevention.
The idea came from a local organization called "Focus 1000." It recognized the importance of working with well-respected and trusted faith leaders.
Reverend Christiana Sutton-Koroma says people were reluctant to accept the importance of Ebola quarantine until it was explained in church.
“That is one key thing the scripture tells us, in (the book of) Leviticus, that when somebody is infected with an infectious skin disease that that individual and community should be quarantined,” said Sutton-Koroma.
In the case of Ebola, a quarantine is necessary as the virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. When Reverend Sutton-Koroma explained this citing the Bible and pointing how it relates to Ebola, people started to listen.
The religious references are helping raise awareness, said Lamaratu Kamara, who attends Sutton-Koroma’s church.
“I have seen it (change) a lot in my community, and thanks be to God that we are all taking precaution,” said Kamara.
Dr. Ramadan Jalloh, an imam in Freetown, was taking examples from the Quran to preach about Ebola in his mosque.
“Islam has warned against anything that will endanger the life of an individual, so if you are going to wash [a] body and touch a body and that is going to cause to leading a problem, then Islam is warning against such an act,” said Jalloh.
The aid agency World Vision is doing similar work with faith leaders across the country. World Vision National Director Leslie Scott says it is because of the religious tolerance the leaders have been able to work so well together.
“If you can credit Sierra Leone for one thing, you can credit it for religious tolerance, and I hope the world will learn from Sierra Leone that Christians and Muslims can live together and do great things, like we have just done with Ebola, fighting Ebola together as one,” said Scott.
Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in Sierra Leone since the virus began spreading here almost a year ago.

Sierra Leone Medical Officer Disputes ‘Underreported’ Ebola Deaths
Sierra Leone’s chief medical officer, Dr. Brima Kargbo, said Ebola deaths in his country are not underreported.
Kargbo was reacting to comments reportedly made Friday by Rony Zachariah of the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
After visiting Sierra Leone, Zachariah said the global total of nearly 5,000 deaths was “underreported.”
Zachariah also reportedly said that Ebola had wiped out “several villages and communities” in Sierra Leone.
But Kargbo said he was not aware of villages being wiped out. He said there is a tendency by some international partners to inflate Ebola figures for Sierra Leone.
“There are probable deaths, suspected deaths, and confirmed deaths, and we only report those deaths that are confirmed as persons infected with Ebola,” he said.
Kargbo said a standard operating procedure has also been developed to test the bodies of people who have died on the community level to determine if the person died from Ebola before that person is buried.
Kargbo said he had no knowledge of some villages being “wiped out,” as alleged by Zachariah.
“I know MSF operates in Kailahun (eastern province) where the situation there has stabilized for the past two months. So, I wonder whether he was referring to earlier days when the epidemic was in the eastern part of the country,” Dr. Kargbo said.
Kargbo said Sierra Leone authorities have observed a tendency by some international partners to inflate Ebola figures.
“About a month ago, we also had a report from Save the Children saying that every hour five people were being infected in Sierra Leone. When we challenged that report, eventually they had to apologize,” Kargbo said.
He said Sierra Leone also challenged an assertion by someone from the International Red Cross saying that every day in Freetown more than 100 corpses were being buried.
“So, I actually do not know why the international partners have been inflating the figures for Sierra Leone,” Kargbo said.
Kargbo said Ebola infection and death rates in most districts of Sierra Leone have generally been on the decline during the past week, except in the western part of the country where higher figures persist.
“For the past one week, we have been seeing stabilization in most of the districts, except the western areas. Now we talk of single digits in Port Loko, in Bombali, in Bo, in Kenema, except for the western areas where we are facing an increase in figures,” Kargbo said.
But a report by the Africa Governance Initiative said Sunday that, “…whilst new cases appear to have slowed in Liberia, Ebola is continuing to spread frighteningly quickly in parts of Sierra Leone.”
The report said, on average, 12 new cases a day were seen in the rural areas surrounding the capital, Freetown, in late October, compared with 1.3 cases in early September.

Report: Iranian Ships Moving Away from Yemen
A U.S. military official said Thursday Iranian cargo ships which may be carrying weapons for Houthi rebels in war-torn Yemen are moving away from that country.
The official, speaking anonymously, calls this a "promising sign."
He said, however, that the Pentagon will continue to watch the ships carefully.
The White House has said it has seen evidence that Iran supplied arms to the Shi'ite Houthis in Yemen. The Pentagon has deployed a number of U.S. warships to Yemeni waters to ensure that key Gulf shipping channels stay open.
Military officials deny the U.S. fleet is there to intercept Iranian ships.
In Yemen, Saudi-led coalition warplanes struck rebel targets Thursday near the southern port of Aden.
The Saudis announced this week that they are officially ending the campaign of airstrikes, but would start up the bombing again if necessary.
A month of airstrikes has killed hundreds of civilians and destroyed homes, but have generally failed to stop the Houthis and return Western-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to Yemen.
He is currently in exile in Saudi Arabia.
Also Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon nominated Mauritanian diplomat Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed as his new special envoy to Yemen.
Cheikh Ahmed, who has been serving as U.N. Ebola chief, would replace Jamal Benomar, who resigned last week after losing support from Gulf countries for his mediation efforts in Yemen.
The appointment becomes official on Monday if no objections are raised by the 15-member Security Council.
'Degraded capabilities'
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, said Wednesday the bombing campaign has achieved its primary objectives.
"We destroyed the air force; we destroyed their ballistic missiles as far as we know; we destroyed their command and control; we destroyed much, if not most, of their heavy equipment and we made it very difficult for them to move from a strategic perspective," al-Jubeir said.
"So we have degraded their capabilities substantially and thereby eliminated the threat that they posed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in the process ensured the safety of our borders, our territory and our citizens," he added.
However, Al-Jubeir said there is "no military solution" to the conflict, and that the only way to achieve peace is through U.N.-sponsored peace talks. The Houthis also have expressed a desire to return to the talks.
Last week, the U.N. secretary-general said the U.N.-supported diplomatic process "remains the best way out of a drawn-out war with terrifying implications for regional stability."
The United States supported the bombings, but also welcomed the decision by the Saudi-led coalition to stop the campaign. The White House called for a quick resumption of talks by all Yemeni parties in an inclusive political transition process.
But White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said despite the declared halt to the airstrikes, there is instability in Yemen and the region. Psaki told CNN that "obviously, the job is not done."
Iran welcomed what it called the end to "killing innocent and defenseless civilians" and called the move a "step forward" toward a political resolution.
According to the World Health Organization, 1,080 people have been killed and 4,352 wounded over the past month in Yemen.

Obama Set to Host US-Africa Summit
WASHINGTON —
President Obama will be welcoming more than 50 African leaders for a three-day U.S.-Africa summit to begin August 4 in Washington, D.C.
Not invited are the presidents of four countries with a record of human rights violations: Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Sudan and Central African Republic. The leaders of Sierra Leone and Liberia have canceled their trips because of the Ebola outbreak in their countries.
At the summit, the U.S. is expected to unveil nearly $1 billion in business deals, more funding for peacekeeping, and commit billions more dollars to food and power programs in Africa.
Administration officials say it’s an opportunity to discuss the future of an economically-growing continent, and address questions about how the U.S. can become a closer partner.
Themed “Investing in the Next Generation," the summit meetings will be designed to identify shared interests that will be needed if the continent is to meet the needs of its young people: health care, education, and work place opportunities.
Story continues after related video report by VOA's Miriama Diallo:
At a time when armed conflict has created a humanitarian emergencies in Central African Republic and South Sudan, and East and West African countries are fighting the spread of radical Islamists, the first goal is to ensure peace and stability needed for development.
Summit participants will discuss how to end violence and ensure both regional and domestic security.

That effort will include reforms to national militaries, says Joseph Siegle, research director for the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at National Defense University in Washington, D.C.
"There’s a recognition that part of the challenge is that Africa’s police and military aren’t always very professional, and this can lead to inappropriate or heavy-handed responses, especially when dealing with domestic security threats, which involve [the killings] a lot of innocent bystanders," he said. "This tends to alienate the local population and further fuel grievances."
"The challenge [for Obama and the heads of state] is how do you [separate and address] the domestic issues and then the transnational components of those threats?"
Trade, investment
On Tuesday, African leaders will meet with government officials at a business forum to address economic security. The gathering is expected to bring together 200 U.S. and African business leaders in order to find ways to strengthen financial ties by boosting trade and investment.
South African President Jacob Zuma and his wife Bongi Ngema arrive at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Aug. 3, 2014 to attend the US - Africa Leaders Summit.
An important part of U.S. trade with Africa trade is the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), U.S. legislation designed to assist economies of sub-Saharan Africa and improve economic relations.
AGOA gives African countries with a good records of economic management and human rights duty-free access to U.S. markets. Today, Africa sells about seven thousand products to the U.S., worth about $27 billion.
More than 20 countries participate in AGOA, but U.S. officials say more could take part.
Experts such as Witney Schneidman, senior international advisor for Africa at the global law firm of Washington-headquartered Covington and Burling, says AGOA should be renewed for 15 years to ensure a stable investing environment.
"Another idea being considered by government officials is to enhance USAID trade hubs in Africa," he said, explaing that the hubs, or information centers, help African businesses export their goods to the U.S. market.
Schneidman also says they should be renamed trade and investment hubs that also help U.S. companies interested in the African market.
"Those trade hubs need to pull together," he said. "We need a whole of government approach so that you have our ambassadors and embassies in lockstep with our commerce and agriculture officials, along with officials from [the Export-Import Bank of the United States] and the [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries].
"[This way] we can present one face," he said. "A one-stop shop to U.S. companies on how the U.S. government can help them be successful in Africa."
Human rights
The summit agenad also includes a session on governance, though some activists say the current meeting schedule does not pay enough attention to human rights and democratization issues.
Civil society groups have voiced displeasure at not being invited to take part in any roundtable discussions with African leaders despite a civil society forum scheduled for Monday.
Adam Shapiro of the human rights group Front Line Defenders said U.S. emphasis on human rights and good governance is what should separate this gathering from recent Africa investment summits held by China, India, Japan and Russia.
Republic of Guinea Prime Minister Mohamed Said Fofana arrives at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Aug. 2, 2014, to attend the US - Africa Leaders Summit.
"In those summits, there were very low expectations from Africa that any kind of issues about governance or human rights or transparency would be brought up," Shapiro said. "But when it comes to the U.S., there is an expectation that these kinds of issues would be on the table."
Shapiro, who wants civil society to be a part of all discussions — especially those on security and good governance — also wants President Obama to publicly identify leaders who’ve gained power through elections and transparency, such as those in Liberia, Ghana, Tanzania and Botswana.
He and other activists have been critical of summit invitations to leaders accused of human rights abuses, such as Teodoro Obian Nguema, long-serving president of Equatorial Guinea, and Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, president of Egypt.
Unlike China’s recent Africa summit, the U.S.-hosted summit will have no one-on-one meetings between the president and the African leaders.
Administration officials say Obama will be spending the entire day meeting with leaders on Wednesday at the heads-of-state summit. Heads of state and business leaders will be able to meet with cabinet-level officials during some of the events.

Liberia's President Discusses US Trip with VOA
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the president of Africare, Dr. Darius Mans, spoke to VOA on Saturday about their meetings in the United States. The interview covered a range of topics, including the fight against Ebola, other health care challenges and the problem of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe.
Sirleaf said she visited the United States at the invitation of President Barack Obama to discuss the fight against Ebola and the progress made in her country and Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three countries hardest hit by the disease. She said Obama reassured her that the United States will continue to support her country as it embarks on its economic recovery plans.
Obama hosted Sirleaf and the presidents of Guinea and Sierra Leone at the Oval Office last week.
Sirleaf said she is hopeful that some of the $1.4 billion the United States has allocated to fight Ebola can be used to support the economic recovery program.
Sirleaf also met with World Bank officials, who agreed to provide $650 million to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone over the next year to year and a-half to help them recover from the Ebola crisis.
She said the fight against Ebola showed problems with Liberia's health care system, that it did not have enough doctors and nurses in place and that all facilities were not up to date. She said Liberia needs to build a health system that has the "capacity to respond," and is working with the CDC and NIH and officials in Britain to develop that system.
Dr. Darius Mans said Africare has worked in Liberia since 1992 and is committed to the long-term there and in the other two countries most affected by Ebola, Guinea and Sierra Leone. He said Africare was able to work in the region to keep clinics open and treat people during the Ebola crisis, and has been involved in talks with all three countries for their recovery plans.
Sirleaf said that empowering communities to take ownership and responsibility in the fight against Ebola was one of her most important decisions. She added that going against her country's long established tradition and ordering the dead to be cremated was difficult, but that she believes it made a difference.
She also discussed African migrants who often perish in the Mediterranean Sea trying to reach Europe. She said countries must work together to fight poverty and address basic needs so the population will not try to make that dangerous journey.

Liberia’s Brumskine Outlines Vision for 2017 Presidential Bid
Liberia’s next presidential election is in 2017, but candidates are already lining up to succeed Africa’s first female elected president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and hopefully dethrone the ruling Unity Party.
Vice President Joseph Boakai has already said he will run in 2017 after being petitioned by citizens from his Lofa County region.
Another candidate is Charles Brumskine of the opposition Liberty Party, who ran in the 2005 and 2011 presidential elections and lost. He said he failed because he did not effectively communicate his vision for the country.
This time around Brumskine said he is running to bring about reconciliation, reform, rebuilding and recovery.
He said he and other opposition candidates should come together to stop what he called the “hegemony” of the ruling Unity Party from wining its third consecutive presidential election.
Has 'a vision'
“I am running because we do have a vision to lead our country and a commitment to serve our people. Our vision is based on what we call the 4Rs – reconciliation, reform, rebuild, and recovery," Brumskine said.
"These are the four pillars of our platform that will take us into the next stage that Liberia should be in for its development,” he added.
Brumskine took responsibility for why his party did not do well in the last two presidential elections.
“As the leader of my party and the candidate myself, I take responsibility for the lack of success in our first two attempts. And I believe it basically had to do with not having communicated effectively our vision for the country of Liberia,” he said.
He said by announcing his candidacy almost a year and a half before the next election, Liberians will know about his party’s platform and gravitate toward the party.
There have been speculations that Brumskine was considering teaming up with Liberian football legend George Weah’s Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) party.
Weah took second place in the last two presidential elections.
Aspirations
Brumskine said he would be willing to let go his own presidential aspiration to join with other opposition parties and come up with a single candidate.
But he said it is a decision that must be made by all parties, and that whoever is chosen as the candidate must be able to win the respect and trust of the Liberian electorate.
“It is our desire to work with every opposition political party and opposition politician to ensure that we together can succeed in 2017," he said.
"The Unity Party has won two consecutive elections. We must make sure they do not win a third election. Otherwise, the opposition in Liberia could crumble and then we will become a one-party state again, something that no one wants,” Brumskine said.
Liberia’s economy is still struggling to rebound almost 11 years after the end of the country’s civil war. It struggles with a high unemployment rate. And the Ebola epidemic has also effectively slowed economic growth.
Brumskine said he will leave it up to Vice President Boakai to defend the record of President Sirleaf’s government, which has been in power nearly 10 years.
Nevertheless, he said the vision and programs of a Brumskine government will be different from the Sirleaf government.
“For example, our philosophy of government, we do not believe that government is the solution for everything. We believe that the private sector is the driving force for growth and development in any economy," Brumskine said.
"We want to make sure that education is dealt with differently by having teachers trained, by creating incentives for qualified people to get into the classrooms for our children and creating a learning environment for them,” he added.
Brumskine said his government’s health policy will focus on the clinical aspect as opposed to what it is today.
Constitutional amendments
Liberians this year began debating amendments to the country’s constitution.
For example, a constitutional convention held in April in central Liberia endorsed an amendment to make Liberia a Christian country.
The delegates approved an amendment limiting terms: presidential office, from six to four years; senators, from nine to six years, and representatives, from six to four years.
They also said the superintendents of the 15 counties or political subdivisions should be elected by the people as opposed to be being appointed by the president.
Brumskine said he supports the de-concentration of power to give the average Liberia a chance to have say in the running of his or her government.
But he said those who support the idea of having superintendents elected by the people should take into consideration the impact it could have on the country’s economy.
“A consideration should be given to whether or not we elect our superintendents because if we were to elect superintendents that would mean the superintendent will not be reporting to the president," he said.
"If you have superintendents elected, you have to have 15 county legislatures to whom the superintendents will have to report. We may not be able to afford that economically, at least for now," he added.
However, Brumskine said decentralization can come about if Liberia reinstates the election of city mayors and tribal chiefs.

Experts Warn World Losing Ebola Fight
The international medical aid group Doctors Without Borders says the world is losing the battle against Ebola and warns the deadly virus will not be stopped unless wealthy nations dispatch specialized biological disaster response teams to West Africa.
The organization's president, Joanne Liu, said Tuesday that her group, which has treated more than 1,000 Ebola patients in West Africa since March, is completely overwhelmed by the disease.
"In Sierra Leone, infectious bodies are rotting in the streets. Rather than building a new Ebola care center in Liberia, we are forced to build crematoria," said Liu.
Her warnings were echoed Tuesday by the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dr. Tom Frieden the situation is now the world's first Ebola epidemic, given how widely it's spreading. He cautioned that while there is a window of opportunity to fight the disease, "the window is closing."
Meanwhile in Liberia, a missionary organization announced that another American doctor has become infected. Serving in Mission said the obstetrician was not treating Ebola patients at the hospital in Monrovia. It did not elaborate how the he contracted the virus.
Also Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama joined the fight against Ebola, recording a message for West Africans on how to avoid and treat the deadly disease.
In a video released by the White House, Obama warns people in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone not to touch the blood, sweat or other body fluids of Ebola patients, and to avoid contaminated items such as used needles.
He warned that those killed by the disease remain contagious.
"When burying someone who has died from this terrible disease, it’s important to not directly touch their body. You can respect your traditions and honor your loved ones without risking the lives of the living," said Obama.
A yi hakuri, babu wannan abinda ake nema yanzu a shafin nan
The West African Ebola outbreak, which has now spread to Senegal as well, has killed more than 1,500 people this year.
The United Nations says the West Africa outbreak has put harvests at risk and sent regional food prices soaring.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization issued the warning Tuesday in a special alert for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries most affected by the outbreak.
The FAO said that in those three countries, quarantine zones and restrictions on people's movement aimed at combating the virus have "seriously curtailed the movement and marketing of food."
The agency said this has led to panic buying, food shortages and major price increases for some commodities. The FAO also warned that labor shortages on farms due to movement restrictions and workers leaving for other areas will seriously impact farm production and jeopardize the food security of many people.

Wrestling With Ethics, Saving Ebola Patients
A Spanish priest and two Americans - a doctor and a hygienist – who contracted the Ebola virus disease were evacuated from Liberia recently. Lengthy testing of several drugs that may save the lives of hundreds of Ebola patients or vaccinate communities against a future epidemic has never been done because no one has stepped forward to fund the final necessary research.
Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria are prepared to offer risks that could mean life of death for more than a thousand people.
Doctors for all three sought access to Z-Mapp, a drug treatment that has not been tested on humans. Whether the Madrid hospital where 75-year-old Father Miguel Pajares died this morning had time to give him the drug is not certain. The two Americans, Dr. Kent Brantly and hygienist Nancy Writebole, are being treated with the same drug in an Atlanta hospital, but their recovery is not yet assured.
The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday approved the use of untested drugs on the grounds that the deadly virus has turned into an international medical emergency. But first, they spent several days wrestling with the ethics of approving Z-Mapp and several other drugs not yet tested in humans.
Do the drugs harm the patient?
“Drugs obviously usually have to go through a three-step process for both safety and effectiveness before they can ever be given to human beings,” says Nancy Kass, a professor of bioethics at John Hopkins University and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. “None of these Ebola drugs have gone through any kind of human testing.”
The four West African governments now seek access to the experimental drugs. Kass says these governments and WHO need to figure out whether it is appropriate to give an experimental “to a few people with Ebola to see what the effects are or - at the very least – do they need to wait until some safety trials are done to make sure that the drug is at very least not harmful?”
The Liberian ministry of health seeking access to experimental drugs for patients now in quarantine has received permission to receive the Z-Mapp experimental treatment. All four African governments face two critical questions, according to Kass. Will patients experience minor or major side effects of the drugs? Even if the drugs don’t harm the patient, do they do any good?
What if Z-Mapp doesn’t work?
“There is a whole other kind of question about whether the drug is effective,” says the bioethicist. “Giving people an ineffective drug sometimes can also be harmful because it can create distrust or it makes public health people think that they have a solution when they don’t.
“But the biggest risk is the safety risk.”
Will those administering the drugs decide to test the toxicity and dosage of the drugs on uninfected volunteers first? “It depends how long they want to wait to see what kind of bad effects there are,” Kass says.
“Safety studies done properly also go gradually. You probably wouldn’t give five people the drug all at the same time in case there is a very serious toxic effect in humans. The best way to do it ethically is to give the drug to humans one at a time and at least wait a couple of days … in case person number one has this horrible an unexpected reaction …To do that safety study would take about a month.”
Experience with drug trials in low-resource countries in Africa, for example, has a politically toxic history in which patient advocates have charged that drug makers in developed countries are exploiting poor populations. Kass says the countries that produce the drugs now seek paid volunteers within their own country in order to monitor risks of serious side effects.
Kass speculates that given the odds that more than one-thousand Ebola victims currently face a 40-percent chance of survival without any drug, medical authorities and public health administrators may skip the safety trials and hope the drugs they give are not only not dangerous but effective.
Nothing to lose
Kass says Ebola patients do have something to lose if they do not take try a new drug that may not be effective. But she says the decisions are not that easy to make for patients or medical personnel.
“A critical question there would be giving it to people who really understand. There is a way you can figure out whether they really understand that it’s still at a fairly experimental stage.” She says researchers usually find that those who are very sick have a hard time understanding, “not because they are sick but because they’re so hopeful that the treatment will be effective.
"And particularly with it having been given to these two Americans, I think there may be a perception problem now that someone has concluded that these drugs are effective, and it couldn’t be further from the truth.”

10th Sierra Leone Doctor Dies of Ebola
A 10th doctor from Sierra Leone died from Ebola, a day after two other Sierra Leone doctors had succumbed to the disease, a health official said Sunday.
Dr. Brima Kargbo, Sierra Leone’s chief medical officer, said Dr. Aiah Solomon Konoyeima had died of Ebola on Saturday. On Friday, Thomas Rogers, a surgeon at the Connaught Hospital, which is the main referral unit in the capital Freetown, and Dauda Koroma both died from the disease.
The details of how and where the doctors had become infected were not known.
Of the 11 Sierra Leonean doctors infected with the disease, only one has survived.
The three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been hardest hit by the current Ebola outbreak, with hundreds of health care workers becoming infected with the disease.
Toll on health care system
The deaths have taken a tremendous toll on health care system in these countries. More than 100 health care workers have lost their lives in Sierra Leone, according to a report by the French news agency AFP.
Konoyeima worked at a children's hospital in Freetown, the capital, and tested positive for Ebola about two weeks ago, according to The Associated Press.
He was being treated at the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center, which is staffed exclusively by local Sierra Leonean medical personnel, as compared to many other treatment units, which are run by international organizations or employ some foreign staff.
In the current outbreak, Ebola has sickened more than 17,500 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Of those, about 6,200 have died. It is currently spreading fastest in Sierra Leone.
The World Health Organization (WHO) set a 60-day goal on October 1 to isolate 70 percent of Ebola patients in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and ensure safe burials for 70 percent of bodies, which are highly infectious.
But in Sierra Leone, only 60 percent of patients were in isolation by December 1, said Palo Conteh, head of the government's National Ebola Response Center.
Material for this report came from AP and AFP.

Sierra Leone Military Constructing Ebola Treatment Centers
Sierra Leone’s national army has teamed up with British medics and engineers to construct Ebola treatment centers across the country, especially in areas worst hit by the disease as part of a bid to combat the disease, according to Col. Michael Samura, spokesman for Sierra Leone’s military.
His comments followed President Ernest Bai Koroma’s plea for more international assistance to help the administration in Freetown combat the dreaded disease. Koroma expressed concern that the global response to Ebola has been slower than the infection rate.
The World Health Organization estimates that 3,865 people have so far died of the Ebola diseases.
Samura said the military has intensified patrolling border areas to ensure those infected with the disease are prevented from coming into the country.
“We still continue our operations along the border areas,” said Samura. “Treatment centers [have been] increased and in fact it is one of those treatment centers that has recently recorded the highest discharge of Ebola patients who have gotten healed.”
Samura said a lot of treatment centers were established following the recent three-day, nationwide shutdown in an effort to help contain the disease.
He said the country’s anti-Ebola effort received a boost following the arrival of a British team of engineers and medical officers.
“The British engineers and medics are in, and they are helping us with the construction of treatment centers across the country, particularly areas that are mostly affected with Ebola. Of course the U.N team is also expected to be in soon,” said Samura. “Our engineers are doing so well assisting the country with the construction of treatment centers all over the country where they are needed.
Some health experts are concerned that Sierra Leoneans residing in neighboring Liberia and Guinea, who may have been exposed to the disease, could return home and unwittingly infecting other citizens – thereby worsening the country’s infection rate.
Samura said Sierra Leone and neighboring countries are working closely to restrict cross-border movements.
“We are all working toward the same goal. So, definitely, as we are preventing people from going across into their country, they are also stopping their own people from coming across to us, because we don’t want people to be moving back and forth, and this is the way eventually, the virus is being spread here and there,” said Samura.

WHO: Ebola Deaths, Infections on the Rise
The number of deaths from Ebola has risen to 9,152, a sharp increase following weeks in which the outbreak appeared to be weakening.
The death toll reported Tuesday by the World Health Organization represents a jump of nearly 150 deaths since the agency's last update three days earlier.
The WHO said the number of new cases climbed by 303, with 136 new cases in Liberia, 113 in Sierra Leone, and 54 in Guinea.
Dr. David Nabarro, the U.N. special envoy on Ebola, told reporters in Geneva that the new numbers showed the outbreak was not yet under control. He said the goal is to reduce the number of new cases to zero.
"Good progress is being made, but the outbreak still represents a grave threat," Nabarro said, "and we really hope that there will be no complacency in anybody involved in the response. We have to really work hard to get zero cases, zero transmissions."
Health experts have cautioned West Africans against becoming complacent about the disease. The WHO recently said a single unsafe burial in Guinea last month caused 11 confirmed Ebola cases.
Those killed by the virus remain contagious and must be buried by workers in protective equipment.
At the United Nations on Tuesday, a letter from three world leaders said the Ebola outbreak had exposed the "weakness'' of international crisis response.
The letter, from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Ghanaian President John Mahama, was given to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. It asked the U.N. chief to create a high-level panel and to commission a report on how nations can react more quickly and with better coordination in the face of disaster.
A large-scale trial of two potential Ebola vaccines began earlier this month in Liberia. Organizers of the study, led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, aim to enlist a total of around 27,000 healthy men and women for the trial.
The WHO has said there is an urgent need to end the outbreak before the wet season begins and access to remote areas becomes more difficult.

Republicans Take Control of US Senate
Republican candidates won enough seats in Tuesday's U.S. congressional elections to capture control of the Senate.
Democrats had held a 55-seat majority in the Senate, but Republicans picked up six seats with wins in Arkansas, Colorado, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.
However, there were several races still to be decided.
In Louisiana, neither candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote. The Senate race between incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu and Republican challenger Bill Cassidy will go to a December 6 runoff.
McConnell reelected
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was reelected in Kentucky to a sixth term, easily beating his Democratic rival, Alison Lundergan Grimes. It was an ugly race, with both sides struggling to outspend the other, and polls showing Grimes leading McConnell as late as last week.
“She earned a lot of votes, and she earned my respect," McConnell said late Tuesday. "It took a lot of guts to take on a race like this. Because of the business we're in, it also meant she'd take some heat. I admire her willingness to step into the arena and fight as hard as she did.”
With Republicans in control, McConnell will become Senate majority leader. He will have the authority to decide which bills to bring up for a vote.
President Barack Obama said Senate Democrats faced what could be the toughest races since 1958, when Republicans lost 13 Senate seats under then-President Dwight Eisenhower.
In the mid-term races for one-third of the 100 senate seats, Republicans needed to gain six seats to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats. Republicans held the majority in the House of Representatives and are expected to increase their numbers.
Republican victories
In other Senate victories for the Republicans, Lindsay Graham was reelected in South Carolina, while a second Republican, Tim Scott, won the election to finish the term of Senator Jim DeMint, who resigned.
Scott became the first African-American elected statewide in South Carolina since the end of the American Civil War.
Republicans also picked up a seat in West Virginia that had been held by Democrats when Representative Shelley Moore Capito won the race to replace retiring Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller.
Former South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds, a Republican, will take over from retiring senator Tim Johnson. Rounds held off Democrat Rick Wieland and two independents.
Republican Cory Gardner defeated Colorado's incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Udall.
Republican Tom Cotton won a bitterly contested Senate race in Arkansas. TV network projections gave Cotton a victory over two-time Democratic Senator Mark Pryor.
But the Democrats also secured a big win for an incumbent Tuesday as Democrat Jeanne Shaheen won re-election to the U.S. Senate from New Hampshire on Tuesday, beating back an aggressive campaign from Republican Scott Brown.
With control of Congress, Republicans could raise new disputes with Obama over his signature legislative achievement, health care reform, which has allowed millions of people to secure insurance coverage they could not previously afford.
Many Republicans view it as excessive government involvement in people's health care and call for repeal of the law.
Attacks on Obama
Republicans also have attacked Obama's handling of the Ebola crisis and called for approval of an oil pipeline from Canada through the central U.S., and a curb on government regulation of businesses.
Some opposition lawmakers have also disputed the president's handling of Russia's intervention in Ukraine and U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
In the United States, the two main political parties are feuding over spending and tax policies and immigration reforms.
Obama has vowed to set new immigration rules by executive order by the end of the year, after the House did not act on comprehensive reforms approved by the Senate.
Some Republicans already are saying they will seek to block the president from unilaterally changing the country's immigration policies to allow millions of migrants who entered illegally to stay in the United States.

Sierra Leone Begins New Ebola 42-day Countdown
A Sierra Leone official said the government is cautiously optimistic the country will successfully complete a new 42-day countdown to be declared Ebola-free without any setback.
The country began the new countdown Saturday after discharging its last two known patients from the International Medical Corps Treatment Center in Kambia District.
Sierra Leone’s hopes of being declared Ebola-free were dashed last August when a 67-year-old woman died in Kambia days after it began the first 42-day countdown.
Abdulai Bayraytay, national publicity and outreach coordinator in the office of Sierra Leone’s government spokesman said the government is intensifying its appeal to the public not to compromise on the measures intended to contain the Ebola virus.
“We are very much cautiously optimistic that we will graduate into the 42-day without any relapse but we are intensifying – as a government and medical people -- that we must not compromise the medical measures that will contain Ebola for its eventual eradication,” he said.
He said Sierra Leone has now gone two days since Saturday into the 42-day countdown to be declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization.
“We discharged the last two patients from our treatment facility – that is International Medical Corps Treatment Center in Kambia District on Saturday, and since that day we are now two days,” Bayraytay said.
Bayraytay said the country is hopeful because no one out of the more than 700 people who have been quarantined in Bombali District has shown any symptoms of the Ebola virus.
“Since the incubation period for the disease is usually 21 days, so those people have now appreciated over 10 days into their quarantine period. And so far we are very lucky nobody has shown any symptoms for the virus,” Bayraytay said.

Text of President Obama's Remarks at the African Union
Remarks as Prepared for Delivery--by President Barack Obama
Address to the People of Africa
African Union Headquarters
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
Good afternoon! Thank you, Madame Chairwoman, for your kind words and your leadership. To Prime Minister Hailemariam and the people of Ethiopia—once again, thank you for your hospitality and for hosting this pan-African institution. Members of the African Union, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen—thank you for welcoming me here today. It is an honor to be the first president of the United States to address the African Union.
I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to the representatives of the more than one billion people of the great African continent. We are joined today by citizens and leaders of civil society and faith communities, and I am especially pleased to see so many young people who embody the energy and optimism of today’s Africa. Hello! Thank you all for being here.
I stand before you as a proud American. I also stand before you as the son of an African. Africa and its people have helped shape who I am and how I see the world. In the villages in Kenya where my father was born, I learned of my ancestors, the life of my grandfather, the dreams of my father and the bonds of family that connect us as Africans and Americans.
As parents, Michelle and I want to make sure that our two daughters know their heritage—European and African, in all its struggle and strength. We’ve stood with them on the shores of West Africa, in those doors of no return, mindful that their ancestors were both slaves and slave owners. We’ve stood with them in that small cell on Robben Island where Nelson Mandela showed the world that, no matter the nature of his physical confinement, he alone was the master of his fate. In others words, Africa and its people teach us a powerful lesson—we must uphold the inherent dignity of every human being.
Dignity—that basic idea that by virtue of our common humanity, no matter where we come from or who we are or what we look like, we are all born equal, touched by the grace of God. Every person has worth. Every person matters. Every person deserves to be treated with decency and respect. Throughout much of history, mankind did not see this. Dignity was seen as a virtue reserved to those of rank or privilege, kings and elders. It took a revolution of the spirit, over many centuries, to open our eyes to the dignity of every person. And around the world, generations have struggled to put this idea into practice in laws and institutions.
So too, here in Africa. This is the cradle of humanity, and ancient African kingdoms were home to great libraries and universities. But the evil of slavery took root, not only abroad, but here on the continent. Colonialism skewed Africa’s economy and robbed people of their capacity to shape their own destiny. Eventually, liberation movements grew. And fifty years ago, in a great burst of self-determination, Africans rejoiced as foreign flags came down and your national flags went up. As South Africa’s Albert Luthuli (La-TOO-lee) said at the time, “the basis for peace and brotherhood in Africa is being restored by the resurrection of national sovereignty and independence, of equality and the dignity of man.”
A half century into this independence era, it is long past time to put aside old stereotypes of an Africa forever mired in poverty and conflict. The world must recognize Africa’s extraordinary progress. Today, Africa is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. Africa’s middle class is projected to grow to more than one billion consumers. With hundreds of millions of mobile phones and surging access to the internet, Africans have the potential to leapfrog old technologies into new prosperity. So Africa is on the move, and a new Africa is emerging.
Propelled by this progress, and in partnership with the world, Africa has achieved historic gains in health. The rate of new HIV/AIDS infections has plummeted. African mothers are more likely to survive childbirth and have healthy babies. Deaths from malaria have been slashed, saving the lives of millions of African children. Millions have been lifted from extreme poverty. Africa has led the world in sending more children to school. Put simply, more and more African men, women and children are living with dignity and hope.
Africa’s progress can also be seen in the institution that brings us together today. When I first came to Sub-Saharan Africa as president, I said that Africa doesn’t need strongmen, it needs strong institutions. One of those institutions can be the African Union. Here, you can come together, with a shared commitment to human dignity and development. Here, your 54 nations pursue a common vision of an “integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa.”
As Africa changes, I’ve called for the world to change its approach to Africa. So many Africans have told me—we don’t just want aid, we want trade that fuels our progress. We don’t want patrons, we want partners who help us build our own capacity to grow. We don’t want the indignity of dependence, we want to make our own choices and determine our own future.
As President, I’ve worked to transform America’s relationship with Africa—so that we’re truly listening to our African friends and working together, as equal partners. And I’m proud of the progress we’ve made. We’ve boosted American exports to this region, part of trade that supports jobs for Africans and Americans. To sustain our momentum—and with the bipartisan support of Members of Congress, twenty of whom are here today—I recently signed the ten year renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
We’ve launched major initiatives to promote food security, public health and access to electricity, and to prepare the next generation of African leaders and entrepreneurs—investments that will help fuel Africa’s rise for decades to come. Last year, I welcomed nearly 50 African presidents and prime ministers to Washington so we could begin a new chapter of cooperation.By coming to the African Union today, I’m looking to build on that commitment. I believe Africa’s rise is also important to the entire world. We will not be able to meet the challenges of our time—from ensuring a strong global economy to facing down violent extremism to combating climate change to ending hunger and extreme poverty—without the voices and contributions of one billion Africans.
Still, even with Africa’s impressive progress, we must acknowledge that these gains rest on a fragile foundation. Alongside new wealth, hundreds of millions of Africans still endure extreme poverty. Alongside high-tech hubs of innovation, many Africans are crowded into shantytowns without power or running water—a level of poverty that’s an assault on human dignity.
Moreover, as the youngest and fastest-growing continent, Africa’s population in the coming decades will double—to some two billion people, and many of them will be young, under 18. On the one hand, this could bring tremendous opportunities as these young Africans harness new technologies and ignite new growth and reforms. On the other hand, we need only look to the Middle East and North Africa to see that large numbers of young people with no jobs and stifled voices can fuel instability and disorder.
I suggest to you that the most urgent task facing Africa today and for the decades ahead is to create opportunity for this next generation. This will be an enormous undertaking. Africa will need to generate millions more jobs than it is doing now. And time is of the essence. The choices made today will shape the trajectory of Africa for decades to come. As your partner and friend, allow me to suggest several ways we can meet this challenge together.
Africa’s progress will depend on unleashing economic growth—not just for the few at the top, but for the many, because an essential element of dignity is being able to live a decent life. That begins with a job, and that requires trade and investment.
Many of your nations have made important reforms to attract investment—it’s been a spark for growth. But in many places across Africa, it’s still too hard to start a venture and to build a business. Governments that take additional reforms to make doing business easier will have an eager partner in America. That includes reforms to help Africa trade more with itself, because the biggest markets for your goods are often right next door. Our work to help Africa modernize customs and border crossings started with the East African Community.Now we’re expanding our efforts across the continent, because it shouldn’t be harder for African countries to trade with each other than it is for you to trade with Europe and America.
Most U.S. trade with the region is with just three countries—South Africa, Nigeria and Angola—and much of that is energy. I want Africans and Americans doing more business together in more sectors in more countries. So we’re increasing trade missions to places like Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. We’re working to help more Africans get their goods to market. Next year, we’ll host another U.S.-Africa Business Forum to mobilize billions of dollars in new trade and investment—so we’re buying more of each other’s products and all growing together.
Of course, the United States isn’t the only country that sees your growth as an opportunity. This is a good thing. When more countries invest responsibly in Africa, it creates more jobs and prosperity for us all. But economic relationships cannot simply be about other countries building infrastructure with foreign labor or extracting Africa’s natural resources. Real economic partnerships have to be a good deal for Africa—they have to create jobs and capacity for Africans. That’s the kind of partnership America offers.
Nothing will unlock Africa’s economic potential more than ending the cancer of corruption. This is not unique to Africa—corruption exists all over the world, including in the United States. Here in Africa, corruption drains billions of dollars from economies—money that could be used to create jobs and to build hospitals and schools. And when someone has to pay a bribe just to start a business or go to school or to get an official to do their job—that’s not “the African way”—it undermines the dignity of the people you represent.
Only Africans can end corruption in their countries. As African governments commit to taking action, the United States will work with you to combat illicit finance, promote good governance, transparency and rule of law. And let me add that criminal networks are both fueling corruption and threatening Africa’s precious wildlife—and with it the tourism that many African economies count on. So America stands with you in the fight against wildlife trafficking.
Ultimately, the most powerful antidote to the old ways of doing things is this new generation of African youth. History shows that the nations that do the best are the ones that invest in the education of their people. In this information age, jobs can flow to where workers are literate, highly skilled and online. And Africa’s young people are ready to compete. As Africa invests in education, our entrepreneurship programs are helping innovators start new businesses and create jobs right here in Africa. And the men and women in our Young African Leaders Initiative today will be leaders who can transform businesses, civil society and governments tomorrow.
Africa’s progress will depend on development that truly lifts countries from poverty to prosperity—because like people everywhere, Africans deserve the dignity of a life free from want. A child born in Africa today is just as equal and just as worthy as a child born in Asia or Europe or America. At the recent development conference here in Addis, African leadership helped forge a new global compact for the financing that fuels development. Under the AU’s leadership, the voice of a united Africa will help shape the world’s next set of development goals, and you’re pursuing a vision of the future you want for Africa.
America’s approach to development—the central focus of our engagement with Africa—is focused on helping you build your own capacity to realize that vision. Instead of just shipping food aid to Africa, we’ve helped more than two million farmers use new techniques to boost their yields, feed more people, and reduce hunger. With our new alliance of governments and the private sector investing billions of dollars in African agriculture, I believe we can achieve our goal and lift 50 million Africans from poverty.
Instead of just sending aid to build power plants, our Power Africa initiative is mobilizing billions of dollars in investments from governments and businesses to reduce the number of Africans living without electricity. An undertaking of this magnitude will not be quick. It will take many years. But working together, I believe we can bring electricity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses and connect more Africans to the global economy.
Instead of just telling Africa you’re on your own in dealing with climate change, we’re delivering new tools and financing to more than 40 African nations to help them prepare and adapt. By harnessing the wind and sun, your vast geothermal energy and rivers for hydropower, you can turn this climate threat into economic opportunity. I urge Africa to join us in rejecting old divides between North and South so we can forge a strong global climate agreement this year. Because sparing some of the world’s poorest people from rising seas, more intense droughts and shortages of water and food is a matter of survival and a matter of human dignity.
Instead of just sending medicine, we’re investing in better treatments and helping Africa better prevent and treat disease. As the United States continues to provide billion of dollars in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and as your countries take greater ownership of health programs, we’re moving toward an historic accomplishment—the first AIDS-free generation. And if the world learned anything from Ebola, it’s that the best way to prevent epidemics is to build strong public health systems that stop diseases from spreading in the first place. America is proud to partner with the AU and African countries in this mission. Today, I can announce that of the $1 billion that the United States is devoting to this work globally, half will support efforts here in Africa.
Africa’s progress will also depend on democracy, because Africans, like people everywhere, deserve the dignity of being in control of their own lives. We all know what the ingredients of real democracy are. They include free and fair elections. Freedom of speech and the press. Freedom of assembly. These rights are universal. They’re written into African constitutions. The African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights declares that “every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being.” From Sierra Leone, Ghana and Benin to Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, democracy has taken root. In Nigeria, more than 28 million voters bravely cast their ballots and power transferred as it should—peacefully.
Yet at this very moment, these same freedoms are denied to many Africans. Democracy is not just formal elections. When journalists are put behind bars for doing their jobs, or activists are threatened as governments crack down on civil society, then you may have democracy in name, but not substance. Nations cannot realize the full promise of independence until they fully protect the rights of their people. This is true even for countries that have made important democratic progress.
As I indicated during my visit to Kenya, the remarkable gains that country has made cannot be jeopardized by restrictions on civil society. Likewise, Ethiopians have much to be proud of, and the elections that took place here occurred without violence. But as I discussed with Prime Minister Hailemariam, that is only the start of democracy. I believe that Ethiopia cannot unleash the full potential of its people if it jails journalists or restricts legitimate opposition groups from participating in the campaign process. And, to his credit, the Prime Minister acknowledged that more work will need to be done if Ethiopia is to be a full-fledged and sustainable democracy.
The bottom line is that when citizens cannot exercise their rights, the world has a responsibility to speak out, and America will, even if it is sometimes uncomfortable—and even when it’s directed toward our friends. We do so not because our democracy is perfect—we are not. More than two centuries since our independence, we are still working to perfect our union. Nor are we immune from criticism. When we fall short of our ideals, we strive to do better. You see, when we speak out for our principles, at home and abroad, we stay true to our values and we help lift up the lives of people beyond our borders.
If I can speak frankly, we believe that other nations can do more to speak out as well, including African nations. Just as other countries championed your break from colonialism, our nations must all raise our voices when universal rights are denied. For if we truly believe that Africans are equal in dignity, then Africans have an equal right to freedoms that are universal—that’s a principle we all have to defend.
Today, Africa’s democratic progress is also at risk from leaders who refuse to step aside when their terms end. I have to be honest with you—I just don’t understand this. I am in my second term. Under our constitution, I cannot run again. There’s still so much I want to get done to keep America moving forward. But the law is the law and no one is above it, not even presidents. And, frankly, I’m looking forward to life after being President. It will mean more time with my family, new ways to serve, and more visits to Africa.
When a leader tries to change the rules in the middle of the game just to stay in office, it risks instability and strife, as we’ve seen in Burundi. And it’s often just a first step down a perilous path. But if a leader thinks they’re the only person who can hold their nation together, then that leader has failed to truly build their country. In contrast, Nelson Mandela—like George Washington—forged a lasting legacy by being willing to leave office and transfer power peacefully. And just as the African Union has condemned coups and illegitimate transfers of power, the AU’s authority and strong voice can also help the people of Africa ensure that their leaders abide by term limits and their constitutions. No one should be president for life.
Africa’s progress will also depend on security and peace—because an essential part of human dignity is being safe and free from fear. In Angola, Mozambique, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we have seen conflicts end and countries work to rebuild. But from Somalia and Nigeria to Mali and Tunisia, terrorists continue to target innocent civilians. Many of these groups claim the banner of religion, but hundreds of millions of African Muslims know that Islam means peace. We must call groups like al Qaeda, ISIL, al-Shabaab and Boko Haram what they are—murderers.
In the face of threats, Africa—and the African Union—has shown leadership. Because of the AU force in Somalia, al-Shabaab controls less territory and the Somali government is growing stronger. In central Africa, the AU-led mission continues to degrade the Lord’s Resistance Army. In the Lake Chad basin, forces from several nations—with the backing of the AU—are fighting to end Boko Haram’s senseless brutality. And today, we salute all those who serve to protect the innocent, including so many brave African peacekeepers.
As Africa stands against terror and conflict, the United States stands with you. With training and support, we’re helping African forces grow stronger. The United States is supporting the AU’s efforts to strengthen peacekeeping, and we’re working with countries in the region to deal with emerging crises with the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership.
The world must do more to help as well. This fall at the United Nations, I will host a summit to secure new commitments to strengthen international support for peacekeeping, including here in Africa. And building on commitments that originated here in the AU, we’ll work to develop a new partnership between the UN and the AU that can provide reliable support for AU peace operations. If African governments and international partners step up with strong support, we can transform how we work together to promote security and peace in Africa.
Our efforts to ensure our shared security must be matched by a commitment to improve governance. Our fight against terrorist groups, for example, will never be won if we fail to address the grievances that terrorists exploit, if we don’t build trust with all communities, and if we don’t uphold the rule of law. There’s a saying, and it’s true—if we sacrifice liberty in the name of security, we risk losing both.
This same seriousness of purpose is needed to end conflicts. In the Central African Republic, the spirit of dialogue recently shown by ordinary citizens must be matched by leaders committed to inclusive elections and a peaceful transition. In Mali, the comprehensive peace agreement must be fulfilled. And leaders in Sudan must know that their nation will never truly thrive so long as they wage war against their own people—and the world will not forget about Darfur.
In South Sudan, the joy of independence has descended into the despair of violence. Neither Salva Kiir nor Riek Machar have shown any interest in sparing their people from this suffering or in reaching a political solution. Yesterday, I met with leaders from this region. We agree that, given the urgency of the situation, Salva Kiir and Riek Machar must reach an agreement by August 17. If they do not, I believe the international community must raise the costs of their intransigence. And the world awaits the report of the AU Commission of Inquiry, because accountability for atrocities must be part of any lasting peace in Africa’s youngest nation.
Finally, Africa’s progress will depend on upholding the human rights of all people—for if each of us is to be treated with dignity, each of must be treated equally. As President, I make it a point to meet with many of our Young African Leaders. One was a young man from Senegal. He said something wonderful about being together with so many of his African brothers and sisters. He said, “here, I have met Africa, the [Africa] I have always believed in. She’s beautiful. She’s young. She’s full of talent and motivation and ambition.” I agree.
Africa is the beautiful, talented daughters who are just as capable as Africa’s sons. As a father, I believe that my two daughters ought to have every chance to pursue their dreams—and the same goes for girls here in Africa. We can’t let old traditions stand in the way. The march of history shows that we have the capacity to broaden our moral imaginations. We come to see that some traditions keep us grounded, but that, in our modern world, other traditions set us back.
When African girls are subjected to the mutilation of their bodies, or early or forced marriage, that sets us back, and it needs to end. When more than 80 percent of new HIV cases in the hardest hit countries are teenage girls, that’s a tragedy and it sets us back. So America is beginning a partnership with ten African countries—Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe—to keep teenage girls safe and AIDS-free. And when girls cannot go to school and grow up not knowing how to read or write—that denies the world future women engineers and presidents—that sets us all back. So as part of America’s support for the education and the health our daughters, my wife Michelle is helping to lead a global campaign, including a new effort in Tanzania and Malawi, with a simple message—let girls learn so they grow up healthy and strong.
Africa is the beautiful, strong women these girls grow to become. The single best indicator of whether a nation will succeed is how it treats its women. When women have health care and education, families are stronger, communities are more prosperous and nations are more successful—just look at all the amazing African women here in this hall today. If you want to empower more women, America will be your partner. Let’s work together to stop sexual assault and domestic violence. Let’s make clear that we will not tolerate rape as weapon of war—it is a crime and those who commit it must be punished. Let’s lift up the next generation of women leaders who can help fight injustice and forge peace and start new businesses and create jobs—and probably hire some men, too. We’ll all be better off when women have equal futures.
And Africa is the beautiful tapestry of your cultures, ethnicities, races and religions. Yesterday, I had the privilege to view Lucy, our oldest ancestor—3.5 million years old. In this tree of humanity, with all our branches and diversity, we all go back to the same root. We are all one family—one tribe. Yet so much of the suffering in our world stems from our failure to remember that; to not recognize ourselves in each other. For when we begin to see others as somehow less than ourselves—when we succumb to artificial divisions of faith or sect or tribe—then even the most awful abuses may seem justified. And in the end, abusers lose their humanity, too. As Madiba taught us, “to be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.”
Every one of us is equal. Every one of us has worth. Every one of us matters. When we respect the freedom of others—no matter the color of their skin, how they pray or who they are or who they love—we are all more free. My dignity depends on yours, and yours on mine. Just imagine if everyone had that spirit in their hearts. Just imagine what the world could look like—the future we could bequeath to all these young people here today.
Yes, in our world, old thinking can be a stubborn thing. But I believe the human heart is stronger. And hearts can change. And then minds open. That’s how change happens. That’s how societies move forward, step by halting step, toward those ideals of justice and equality. That’s how your nations won independence. It’s how African Americans won our civil rights. It’s how South Africans—black and white—tore down apartheid. And it’s why I can stand before you today as the first African American president of the United States.
Unleashing growth that creates opportunity. Promoting development that lifts people from poverty. Supporting democracy that gives citizens their say. Advancing the security and justice that delivers peace. Respecting the human rights of all people. These are the keys to progress, in Africa and around the world. This is the work we can do together—and I am hopeful.
As I prepare to return home, my thoughts are the same as that young man from Senegal. “Here, I have met Africa, the [Africa] I have always believed in. She’s beautiful. She’s young. She’s full of talent and motivation and ambition.” To which I would simply add, as you build the Africa you believe in, you will have no better partner and friend than the United States of America. God bless Africa. Thank you.

The president of the Ghana Medical Association (GMA) says the group plans on Tuesday to brief parliament about the country’s preparations for handling cases of the Ebola virus, which has so far affected four West African countries.
Dr. Kwabena Opoku-Adusei expressed concern that the country appears ill prepared to handle cases of the outbreak noting that medical gear bought by the administration to protect health workers is not enough.
“We are lucky to have a series of warnings so that we could be in a better position to be prepared when the disease eventually comes in country. But, I am afraid as at today, we are prepared on paper, but not prepared on the ground,” said Opoku-Adusei. “We have a scheduled meeting with the parliamentary committee on health and the [GMA] is going to make a presentation to them about how it can help alleviate the problem.”
Opoku-Adusei says the GMA will also brief the lawmakers about measures the government can take to combat the disease. He says the country currently has no medical structures in place to contain the virus.
Opoku-Adusei expressed concern about the country’s porous borders which could allow infected people to cross into the country.
“The actual treatment and management areas are yet to be set up,” said Opoku-Adusei. “Our borders are not well manned and are not well screened. We have reports that people just passed through from all [of the infected] countries into our country. So we are going to discuss that [on Tuesday]. As at today, assuming we have a case today or tomorrow, I am afraid we may not be able to manage it properly.”
The World Health Organization estimates that the Ebola disease has left over 1,069 dead. The affected countries include Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.
Government officials say equipment has been purchased to help with the treatment of Ebola cases. The ministry of health has so far released about $1,657,458 to help control the spread of the virus.
But, Opoku-Adusei expressed concern about the lack of public understanding about the disease.
“The level of education for the average Ghanaian is also low. Yes, our government is doing something, but we are afraid it’s not enough,”said Opoku-Adusei.
“There is some equipment in some of our centers, but then I am afraid they are not enough. And we are yet to do training for doctors and other health workers so that they have the confidence to restrain and manage the disease.”
Opoku-Adusei says medical professionals need to be adequately prepared to handle patients affected by the virus.

Obama to Welcome African Leaders to Washington
U.S. President Barack Obama is gathering nearly 50 African heads of state in Washington for an unprecedented summit.
Washington is hoping to make U.S. businesses aware of the opportunities for their companies in Africa.
Africa is economically one of the fastest growing continents and is also one of the continents where the United States is most popular. However, many U.S. business have been slow to invest in Africa.
The summit beginning Monday follows similar efforts by China, Europe and Japan who are all keenly aware of Africa's natural wealth, as well its market of hundreds of millions of middle-class Africans.
U.S. officials say only four African leaders were excluded from the talks - the presidents of Zimbabwe, Sudan, Eritrea and the Central African Republic.
The summit convenes at the same time several West African nations are facing an Ebola virus outbreak.
President Obama said Friday the United States is closely following the situation. He said African officials from at-risk countries will be screened for the disease before entering the U.S.
The leaders of Sierra Leone and Liberia have canceled their summit trips to Washington because of the Ebola outbreak.

Ebola Researchers Race to Slow Epidemic
As it stands now, treating Ebola-infected people is a race against time.
It is a race that 44-year-old Martin Salia, a native of Sierra Leone, lost this week when he died very shortly after being flown from Sierra Leone to the United States for treatment.
Salia was the chief medical officer and surgeon at the Kissy United Methodist Hospital in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, where he contracted Ebola. By the time he arrived at a specialized treatment facility in Nebraska, he was already in critical condition, and despite intensive medical intervention, he died.
His story is a case in point of the conundrum presented by the current outbreak.
"For Ebola…you get virus in a detectable place, which is really the blood, [when] or slightly after you see signs of infection,” said Dr. John Connor, a microbiologist at the University of Boston who has studied Lassa and Marburg viruses, both closely related to Ebola.
“And so if you wait for them to show signs of disease and then maybe a couple of other extra days for [the] virus to be very plentiful in the blood so you can see it with current diagnostics, that therapeutic window is slipping away from you,” he said.
Researchers are working to close that window by creating a diagnostic test that will indicate exposure to the virus much sooner. Faster diagnoses would allow more time for treatment, isolation and contact tracing with the aim of stemming the current epidemic, which the World Health Organization estimates has killed more than 5,100 people.
To do that, scientists are faced with trying to detect something that is not yet present.
"Essentially the question was, can we look in the blood and try and find early markers that might indicate that the host is responding to the disease in a way that we can track that as early as possible,” said Connor.
Working with scientists at the United States Army Medical Research Infectious Disease Institute (USAMRIID) in Maryland, he successfully identified markers in Lassa and Marburg viral infections.
And the so-called “sequencing data” of a similar USAMRIID study of Ebola-infected macaque primates is now ready for Connor’s team to analyze.
Silent infections
Another line of inquiry is looking into why some people who are Ebola-infected never get sick, a phenomenon known in scientific circles as “asymptomatic Ebola infection.”
“People can be exposed to the virus, develop an infection but never know it because their body successfully fights it off,” said Dr. Steve Bellan, a researcher at the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics University of Texas at Austin. Bellan reviewed all the available data on asymptomatic Ebola infections, the results of which were published in a letter to The Lancet journal.
“And there is actually substantial evidence that this happens relatively frequently, particularly from one study of an outbreak in Gabon in 1996, where they did a lot of virological and immunological work,” said Bellan.
In the Gabon study of the 1996 outbreak, researchers monitored 24 contacts of known Ebola cases that never became sick and found that 46 percent of these individuals – a total of 11 people – were infected but never became sick. They also discovered that they mounted immune responses, finding tiny amounts of virus that were present for a very short time before their immune systems kicked in.
That response indicates that the infected person may – emphasis on may – develop protective immunity, a key distinction.
“The fact that someone develops an immune response shows that they were exposed to the virus, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are immune,” he said. “If they were exposed again, then they might successfully fight it off and they might not. We don’t really have enough evidence to know whether it’s protective yet.”
This scientific query could yield very practical applications in the form of faster disease control measures, including a vaccine, and putting Ebola immune people on the frontline of caring for Ebola patients, preventing the spread to non-immune health workers.
But further study of silent infections is very difficult, according to Dr. John Schieffelin, an assistant professor at Tulane University’s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, in part because the spectrum of Ebola disease is enormous, he said.
“There were a lot of people who I was convinced that they had been sent there by some kind of error, just totally couldn't believe that anybody would have thought that they might have Ebola. And almost all of them turned out to be positive,” said Schieffelin, who spent several weeks working in Sierra Leone this fall and co-authored the results of a study of Ebola patients from the current outbreak.
“And there was the minority of people who showed up with what we all imagine is the classic Ebola patient, who had a lot of bleeding and were really, really sick, and obviously did really poorly. And then things in between."
A teacher uses a thermometer to test students' temperature checking for signs of Ebola virus at Aiyetoro African Church Nursery and Primary school in Lagos, Nigeria on Oct. 8, 2014.
Researchers point out it is very difficult to find out how many people are asymptomatic because they don’t seek treatment – and, as such, do not get registered and identified in any healthcare system.
Alongside efforts to come up with a vaccine, Bellan believes the idea of delving more deeply into asymptomatic Ebola infections is beginning to catch on.
“It’s still quite early,” he said. “To do this you have to be collecting blood in outbreak settings, which has its own risks. And these studies have to be done very carefully.”

Cameroon Denies Diplomatic Row With Nigeria Over Ebola
Cameroon’s information minister says it is unlikely the country’s decision to close its border with neighboring Nigeria due to the ongoing Ebola crisis would undermine warm diplomatic relations between Yaoundé and Abuja.
Issa Tchiroma said Cameroon had no choice but to close the border, admitting that the decision could have an adverse impact on Cameroon’s economy, since the Central African nation enjoys significant trade with Nigeria, which is Africa’s biggest economy.
There have been 12 confirmed Ebola cases in Nigeria with at least four deaths.
The World Health Organization estimates that about 1,350 people have so far died of Ebola, with about 2,473 confirmed cases. The West African countries battling Ebola include Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Tchiroma said Cameroon closed its border with Nigeria in a bid to protect citizens from the deadly disease.
“The best way to address this issue given the fact that there is no medicine to curb this disease, the best way to address it is to close the border. But, this will not last forever,” said Tchiroma. “We it just because there is no other alternative, [and] we hope that it will not last for more than two to three weeks.”
Some Cameroonians have expressed concern that Yaoundé’s decision to close its border could signal a lack of trust in Nigeria’s effort to curb the disease, which they contend could sour relations between the neighboring countries.
Tchiroma disagreed, saying the decision to close the border was not ill-intentioned.
“Abuja cannot blame Cameroon for taking the necessary precaution to protect the health and the lives of our people. We have to place the lives and health of our people above everything else and that is why the government has to do it,” said Tchiroma.
Tchiroma outlined the importance of the “strong” trade relations with Nigeria after conceding that the decision could negatively have an impact on Cameroon’s economy.
“We have the full knowledge of the consequences and inconvenience that this measure will cause to Cameroon but, we have no choice,” said Tchiroma. “We didn’t do it to harm our relations with Nigeria we didn’t do it to jeopardize the diplomatic relations with Nigeria…I am convinced [that] Nigeria politicians and leaders will understand Cameroon’s [decision].”

Ebola Increases Threat to Sierra Leone Pregnancies
KAILAHUN, SIERRA LEONE —
Sierra Leone has one of the world’s highest infant mortality rates, and the Ebola outbreak is likely to push it even higher. Health officials say almost all pregnant women infected with Ebola, along with their unborn babies, die from the disease.
It’s a grim baseline. Last year, 107 out of every 1,000 infants born alive in the West African nation had died before their first birthday – compared with 65 in Guinea and 54 in Liberia, the two other countries most devastated by Ebola, or 6 in the United States. Those figures were compiled by the World Bank before the current outbreak began in March. Fetal mortality rates were not readily available.
Kailahun district in eastern Sierra Leone has the country's first and largest Ebola treatment center.
There, Doctors Without Borders has brought in midwife Ruth Kauffman to tend to three pregnant women who have the deadly virus.
Kauffman says there have been no reported cases of pregnant mothers and unborn babies surviving Ebola in Sierra Leone. Authorities do not know how many have died already.
"Especially in outbreaks, there are some groups of people who are more vulnerable than others," Kauffman says. "And what we see with Ebola is that if women [who] are pregnant contract Ebola, they have almost a 100 percent mortality rate."
The aid group's treatment center has set up a specialized ward for these pregnant mothers, says Axelle Vandoornick, the center’s field coordinator.
She said the midwife has "been on standby since yesterday, because, of course, a delivery is a very high-risk situation to carry out."
Kumbu Sakila survived Ebola, but her 24-week-old fetus did not. She has been at the treatment center three weeks, waiting to deliver the dead child she is still carrying.
Midwife Kauffman says Ebola presents an extra challenge during pregnancy and delivery.
At the Ebola treatment unit, medical personnel must fully cover themselves in protective gear that, especially in warm weather, become so hot and restrictive they can only work in it for an hour before risking dehydration.
"The way we can give medical care is very difficult because we cannot spend a lot of time with people," Kauffman said. "You can't spend a lot of time talking. You can't spend a lot of time, really, with one-on-one care, so it makes it challenging in that way, too."
The Ebola outbreak is straining an already-overburdened health care system in a country still recovering from a devastating civil war.
"They've lost a lot of really good health professionals" to Ebola, Kauffman said. The disease is "decimating the health infrastructure. It's going to impact everything from food production to family security to trust of the government to [the] economy. … It's hard to see Sierra Leone having to fight another battle."
The long-term impact of the Ebola outbreak on West Africa's maternal and infant mortality rates is still unknown. What seems certain is that the country's health care system remains crippled for now.

Ebola Kills Another 84 in West Africa Over 3-day Period
The World Health Organization said another 84 people have died in West Africa as a result of the Ebola virus, bringing the death toll from the epidemic to 1,229.
The U.N. health agency on Tuesday announced the number of confirmed and likely infections has risen to 2,240, including 113 new cases reported late last week.
The majority of the new deaths were in Liberia, where authorities are struggling to contain the virus.
Between Aug. 14-16, Liberia recorded 53 new deaths, followed by Sierra Leone, with 17, and Guinea, with 14.
The Liberian government said it has accounted for all 37 suspected Ebola patients who fled an isolation center in the capital, Monrovia, when it was attacked and looted by armed men Sunday.​
The information ministry said there was a "misunderstanding" among nearby residents who thought the center was bringing in Ebola victims from the rest of the country.
The incident raised fears that the fleeing patients could widen the contagion. Liberia sent police to track down the fugitive suspected cases.
The medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said it has opened a new 120-bed Ebola management facility in Monrovia. Much of the city's established health care system has shut down because of doctors and other personnel's fears of Ebola.
3 health workers recovering
Liberia's government also reported the improving health of three Ebola-infected health care workers who received the experimental drug Zmapp.
Medical professionals treating the three workers reported they are showing "very positive signs of recovery" and are making "remarkable" progress, the government said.
The drug, produced by the American company Mapp Biopharmaceutical, has not been formally tested. It is not known if the health care workers' improvement is a result of the treatment.
The outbreak in four West African countries – Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria – is the biggest Ebola epidemic to date.
Neighboring West African countries have taken precautions, including Cameroon, which on Tuesday closed all of its borders with neighboring Nigeria.
Government officials said it was better try to prevent infections than try to heal those infected with the virus.
'Cautious optimism' on Nigeria
On a more hopeful note, the WHO expressed “cautious optimism” that the spread of the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation where four deaths out of 12 confirmed cases have been recorded since July, could be stopped.
A patient brought Ebola into the country last month when he flew into Lagos from heavily affected Liberia. He subsequently infected several people with the deadly disease.

But WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib says the city’s 12 confirmed cases of Ebola and four deaths are all part of a single chain of transmission, which she says is encouraging.
“The situation seems quite good in Nigeria and this is also a sign that the health authorities in Nigeria have taken all the right measures to detect, follow, and trace all the contacts of this man. And, also to do a very comprehensive surveillance to detect any other Ebola cases," said Chaib.
Chaib says Nigeria will have to pass through two incubation periods of 21 days each and if no cases of the disease are confirmed for 42 days the country will be declared free of this dreaded disease.
“We are not yet there. We have some 10 days in Nigeria in order to make this statement," said Chaib.
It also described the situation in Guinea, where the virus made its first appearance in West Africa in December, as currently “less alarming” than in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The WHO noted that governments have set up quarantine zones in parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The agency said it is working with the U.N. World Food Program to distribute food to about 1 million people living in those areas.
Fears of the disease and quarantine measures such as military and police roadblocks have stopped farmers from reaching their fields, and as a result food output has dropped, raising fears that a famine could set in on top of the deadly illness.
“We think that even beyond the control of the outbreak there will be severe food shortage,” said Gon Myers, WFP country director for Sierra Leone. The extra food deliveries would be trying to reach 400,000 people in Sierra Leone alone.
The U.N. health organization is also urging authorities in the affected countries to screen all passengers leaving airports, seaports and major border crossings for signs of the virus.
Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person.
The disease causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea and uncontrollable bleeding through bodily openings, including the eyes, ears and nose.
Previous outbreaks have had a death rate of up to 90 percent, although the death rate in the current epidemic is closer to 50 percent.

West African Economies Hard-Hit by Ebola
In 2013, the World Bank ranked Sierra Leone and Liberia as second and sixth respectively among the top 10 countries with the fastest-growing GDPs. But the ongoing Ebola outbreak is threatening to change that. As the numbers of cases and deaths continue to rise, financial institutions like the World Bank say the economies of the three most affected countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, are being hit hard - and the impact could grow if the Ebola epidemic is not quickly contained.
The death toll from Ebola in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is approaching 4,000. If the epidemic continues, the World Bank says the impact on the countries' economies could be disastrous.
At a gathering in Washington, the presidents of those three countries pleaded with global development leaders for help. Sierra Leone’s Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberia’s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf joined the conversation via video conference.
“Ebola is now causing great destruction to agricultural, mining, manufacturing, construction, tourism, transportation and posing a significant threat to human development, state security and poverty reduction. Government revenues are drying out," said Koroma.
“Restrictions imposed on air and sea travel resulted in increased cost of travel and increase commodity prices affecting the poor," said Sirleaf.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim says growth projections for 2014 have already been cut significantly and will be cut again next year if this disease is not contained.
“As much as $32.6 billion could be lost by the end of 2015. This is a potentially catastrophic impact," said Kim.
David Evans, a World Bank senior economist, says the countries have already been hit with serious losses.
“Across the three countries, we are seeing more than $350 million of lost output. What that means is that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea will be more than $350 million poorer than they would have been in the absence of this disease," said Evans.
Take West Africa's flight industry, for example.
“What we’ve seen is that through August we’ve had more than 30 flights per week going in and out of Sierra Leone; that has dropped to six in September. We see fuel sales and other leading indicators [like] cement sales are dropping significant percentage points, so people are just afraid to invest," said Evans.
Amadou Sy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says the consequences go beyond what’s happening right now.
“On the [one] hand, all your revenues are going down because of the reduced economic activity and on the other hand you have these health expenditures, security, so you are having a fiscal deficit that’s going to be much bigger than you expected," said Sy.
Guinea's President Alpha Conde, who was at the meeting in person, confirmed that view, saying his country and others are going to need "budgetary support" to fund the fight against Ebola.

Mali Attempts to Shut Down Ebola Transmission Chain
BAMAKO/KOUREMALE, MALI —
Senegal and Nigeria were able to stop small Ebola outbreaks by closely monitoring those who had contact with the sick person and quickly isolating anyone with symptoms.
Mali is scrambling to do the same now, almost a month after a 70-year-old Guinean imam sought treatment at a clinic in Bamako. Five people have already died. Mali confirmed a sixth related Ebola case Saturday; a female relative of a nurse who treated the imam.
Every day, twice a day, teams are checking just over 300 people around Bamako. All of these contacts are linked to the Guinean imam who died of Ebola at a private clinic October 27, two days after he had arrived for treatment.
Monitors have caught one case so far - a female relative of a nurse who died after treating the imam. The nurse had the most contacts - 98.
VOA accompanied monitors to the house. At least 40 family members line up in the courtyard to have their temperatures taken.
Two boys, the self-appointed soap police, man a hand washing station at the door.
The head of the household scolds one boy who takes too long to get up when his name is called. The monitors ask about symptoms. The first half of one monitor’s spreadsheet is column after column of tiny handwritten zeroes. No symptoms.
Not all of the contacts are as cooperative as this family. A few do go missing. Monitors think one man went to his village, but phone networks are bad.
“You haven’t been able to reach him?” Dr. Ramata Sacko asks the team at a meeting later. “Didn’t we tell him not to travel?”
Dr. Sacko is coordinating for Ebola monitoring efforts. The teams are learning on the job.
“If they don’t come to us, we go to them,” she tells the team. “If we can figure out his village, we can see if there is a health post there and get him that way. Because this is the critical period,” she says. “We don’t want him to develop symptoms there.”
Mali is playing catch-up. The circle of contacts widened rapidly in the two weeks that went by before health authorities here found out about the imam. The clinic had not tested him.
The World Health Organization in Guinea figured it out while investigating other cases in the imam’s family. Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall of the WHO in Mali got the news. By then, at least three people in Mali were already sick. It's a cautionary tale for other countries in the region.
Dr. Fall says “this never should have happened in a private or public clinic. Everyone knows the situation in Guinea. Had we known sooner,” he says, “we could have prevented a certain number of contacts. It was late.”
Mali is investigating the clinic and how the sick imam got past border police in Kouremale. The town straddles the border. The imam was from the Guinean side. He was buried there after he died in Bamako.
At the border, Malian health workers now check everyone who comes in.
Health workers write down names, phone numbers, destinations. They say their orders are to turn back anyone with a medical condition.
A frustrated Malian man sits with his luggage at the town’s health center. He broke his arm in Conakry. They will not let him cross. He worries people will think he has Ebola.
At the Kouremale health center, Ebola information sheets in pristine plastic sleeves paper the walls. Medical staff wear gloves and sanitize equipment between patients.
Chief Dr. Drissa Berte says they started after the imam. “Everyone is afraid but we're health workers so we cannot show it.” He says “we have to stay calm. If we show we are afraid, it would be panic.”
The clinic has a small isolation tent and a makeshift ambulance. A larger isolation unit is under construction behind the border post. But an infected person may not show symptoms at the border. Ebola has a 21-day incubation period. The whole country has to be vigilant.

Gene Studies of Ebola in Sierra Leone Show Virus Mutating Fast
CHICAGO —
Genetic studies of some of the earliest Ebola cases in Sierra Leone reveal more than 300 genetic changes in the virus as it leapt from person to person, changes that could blunt the effectiveness of diagnostic tests and experimental treatments now in development, researchers said on Thursday.
“We found the virus is doing what viruses do. It's mutating,” said Pardis Sabeti of Harvard University and the Broad Institute, who led the massive study of samples from 78 people in Sierra Leone, all of whose infections could be traced to a faith healer whose claims of a cure attracted Ebola patients from Guinea, where the virus first took hold.
The findings, published in Science, suggest the virus is mutating quickly and in ways that could affect current diagnostics and future vaccines and treatments, such as GlaxoSmithKline's Ebola vaccine, which was just fast-tracked to begin clinical trials, or the antibody drug ZMapp, being developed by California biotech Mapp Biopharmaceutical.
The findings come as the World Health Organization said that the epidemic could infect more than 20,000 people and spread to more countries. A WHO representative could not immediately be reached for comment on the latest genetic study.
Study coauthor Robert Garry of Tulane University said the virus is mutating at twice the rate in people as it was in animal hosts, such as fruit bats.
Garry said the study has shown changes in the glycoprotein, the surface protein that binds the virus to human cells, allowing it to start replicating in its human host. “It's also what your immune system will recognize,” he said.
In an unusual step, the researchers posted the sequences online as soon as they became available, giving other researchers early access to the data.
Erica Ollmann Saphire of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, has already checked the data to see if it impacts the three antibodies in ZMapp, a drug in short supply that has been tried on several individuals, including the two U.S. missionaries who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone and who have since recovered.
“It appears that they do not [affect ZMapp],” said Saphire, who directs a consortium to develop antibody treatments for Ebola and related viruses. But she said the data “will be critical to seeing if any of the other antibodies in our pool could be affected.”
Saphire said the speed with which Sabeti and colleagues mapped genetic changes in the virus gives researchers information that “will also be critical” to companies developing RNA-based therapeutics.
That could impact treatments under way from Vancouver-based Tekmira Pharmaceuticals and privately-held Profectus BioSciences of Tarrytown, New York.
Part of what makes the data useful is the precise picture it paints as the epidemic unfolded. Sabeti credits years of work by her lab, colleagues at Tulane and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation in developing a response network for Lassa fever, a virus similar to Ebola that is endemic in West Africa.
Several of the study authors gave their lives to the work, including Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, the beloved “hero” doctor from the Kenema Government Hospital, who died from Ebola.
The team had been doing surveillance for two months when the first case of Ebola arrived from Guinea on May 25. That case involved a “sowei” or tribal healer, whose claim of a cure lured sick Ebola victims from nearby Guinea.
“When she contracted Ebola and died, there were a lot of people who came to her funeral,” Garry said. One of these was a young pregnant woman who became infected and traveled to Kenema Government Hospital, where she was diagnosed with Ebola.
With the Lassa surveillance team in place, they quickly began testing samples.
“We've been able to capture the initial spread from that one person and to follow all of these contacts and everything with sequencing,” Garry said.
The team used a technique called deep sequencing in which sequences are done repeatedly to generate highly specific results, allowing them to see not only how the virus is mutating from person to person, but how it is mutating in cells within the same person.
What is not clear from the study is whether the mutations are fueling the epidemic by allowing the virus to grow better in people and become easier to spread. That will require further tests in the lab, Garry said.

US Doctor Infected with Ebola 'Improving'
A top U.S. health official says that the American doctor who contracted the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia "seems to be improving."
The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tom Frieden, said Sunday that he cannot predict the future for individual patients, but that it is encouraging that Dr. Kent Brantly appears to be getting better.
Brantly, with help, was able to walk into a hospital in the southern U.S. state of Georgia on Saturday after a flight from Africa in a special isolation unit. He had been in Liberia working for a Christian charity responding to the worst Ebola outbreak on record, with more than 700 people in West Africa dying from the infection.
One of Brantly's colleagues, missionary Nancy Writebol, contracted Ebola alongside him and is also expected to be returned to the U.S. for treatment in the coming days.
Frieden told CBS's Face the Nation program that a widespread outbreak of the disease in the U.S. is unlikely because the United States has better infection controls in hospitals and burial procedures than in Africa.
Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus with a death rate of up to 90 percent of those infected. The death rate in the current epidemic has been about 60 percent.

Liberian Doctor Dies of Ebola
A senior doctor working at Liberia's largest hospital has died of Ebola.
The Liberian Health Ministry says Dr. Samuel Brisbane died Saturday at an Ebola treatment center on the outskirts of the capital, Monrovia.
He is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak the World Health Organization says has killed 129 people in the country.
The U.S. based aid group Samaritan's Purse said Saturday an American doctor working in Liberia is also sick.
A spokeswoman for the group says Dr. Kent Brantly is undergoing intensive medical treatment. She says patients have a better chance of survival if they receive treatment immediately after being infected, which Brantly did.
The World Health Organization says highly contagious Ebola virus has killed at least 672 people in four African countries this year.
In Sierra Leone, health officials say an Ebola patient whose family sparked a nationwide hunt when they forcefully removed her from a treatment center and took her to a traditional healer, died in an ambulance on the way to a hospital.
Health officials say fear and mistrust of health workers in Sierra Leone, where many people have more faith in traditional medicine, are hurting efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak.
The WHO says the outbreak, the largest ever recorded, has also killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone.
Meanwhile, Nigeria has stepped up surveillance at its ports and borders, following the country's first confirmed death from the Ebola virus.
Deadliest Ebola Outbreaks
Health officials are monitoring airports, seaports and land borders for people arriving who may show signs of the virus. Officials confirmed Friday that a man who died after arriving in Lagos on a flight from Liberia had tested positive for Ebola.
Investigators are trying to track down the other passengers who were on the nearly three-hour flight from Monrovia.
There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which causes symptoms that include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.
Health workers are at serious risk of contracting the disease, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids.

Ebola Returns to Liberia
DAKAR / MONROVIA —
A 17-year-old boy has died from Ebola in Liberia, just seven weeks after the World Health Organization declared the country free of the deadly virus. Officials are trying to determine how the boy contracted the illness.
Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah, who heads Liberia’s Ebola response, told VOA the teenager died June 24 and was given a safe burial the next day.
“Our team was there yesterday [June 29] to investigate the situation and know the area. But to be vigilant is good. We were vigilant. Our surveillance team [is] working very, very well. They have picked up this dead child from his parents’ home, tested it yesterday and the child was positive," Nyenswah said.
He says it is not known yet how the boy contracted the disease, but the case is under investigation. He stressed the public should not panic, noting this is the only known case since the country was declared Ebola-free by WHO officials on May 9.
“Margibi County is responding and no need to panic," Nyenswah said. "People hearing me please lower your blood pressure. We are on top of this. The Ministry of Health, this is something we know how to deal with.”
But that message appears to be landing on deaf ears of a traumatized public.
A resident of the affected community, Gbateme Succes Sneah, says memories of the thousands who died haunt him. He says he saw first-hand the impact it had on the survivors and it is very scary to think the virus is back.
“I am very scared ... you know how difficult it was for our citizens who were in business; entrepreneurs who travelled to all the countries and how difficult it was for them. People got stigmatized," Sneah said.
Mother of four children, Comfort Freeman, feels the same.
“We, the people, can take precautions. But the children can not take precautions," she said. "So I am feeling so down this morning. I know in God we trust. He can do anything possible.”
The virus has killed more than 11,100 people since the outbreak began in late December 2013 – hitting Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Guinea declared a three week quarantine this month in a new effort to eradicate Ebola.

Divisions on Ebola Quarantine Procedures Emerge in US
Divisions have emerged between top U.S. health officials and two state governors who imposed rigorous quarantine protocols for American medical professionals returning from Ebola-stricken African nations.
Fears of possible Ebola contagion in one of America’s largest and most-densely populated cities, New York, led Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Governor Chris Christie in neighboring New Jersey, to strengthen quarantine measures in their states.
Triggering concerns: Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who had worked in the West African nation of Guine and is now being treated for Ebola in a New York hospital while his fiancé remains under house quarantine.
'Dignity and humanity'
Also registering are complaints from a Kaci Hickox, a nurse who returned from Sierra Leone and is now under mandatory isolation in New Jersey. Hickox ran a fever but has tested negative for Ebola. She wrote a U.S. newspaper that “the U.S. must treat returning health care workers with dignity and humanity.”
“This is too serious to be dealing with voluntary quarantine. It makes no sense to me. We are significantly increasing the screening process for people who want to come into the New York-New Jersey area," Cuomo said.
"We have the legal authority to do it. We are doing it," Christie said.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland, is critical of quarantine protocols in New York and New Jersey.
"One, we need to protect the American public. But, two, we need to make decisions based on scientific data," Fauci said.
“As a scientist and a health care person, if I were asked, I would not have recommended that. The scientific data tells us that people who are without symptoms and with whom you do not come into contact with body fluids are not a threat," he said.
Cured Ebola patient
Last week, President Barack Obama hugged cured Ebola patient Nina Pham. Pham, a nurse, had contracted the disease while caring for a Liberian man in a Dallas, Texas, hospital.
Obama said, “We have to work together at every level: federal, state, and local. And we have to keep leading the global response, because the best way to stop this disease, the best way to keep Americans safe, is to stop it at its source in West Africa.”
But New Jersey Governor Christie is defending his decision to boost quarantine protocols.
“My first and foremost obligation is to protect the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey," he said.
As U.S. fears over Ebola continue, African immigrants marched to the United Nations, decrying stigmatization they perceive from society at large.

CDC Chief: Ebola Is Worst Outbreak Since AIDS
A top U.S. health official says Ebola is the biggest world health crisis since HIV/AIDS.
Dr. Thomas Frieden spoke Thursday at World Bank headquarters in Washington during a meeting on the Ebola outbreak that has crippled three West African nations and has been detected in several other countries.
Frieden, who leads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, predicted the fight to wipe out the disease will be a long one because the virus keeps changing. He said the only outbreak he has seen resembling the current one is AIDS, and he added that the world community must work hard so this is not the next AIDS.
US fears grow
Meanwhile, fears are growing in the United States about Ebola with about 200 airline cabin cleaners walking off the job in New York and some lawmakers demanding the government ban travelers from the West African countries hit hardest by the virus.
"The nation is frightened, and people are frightened of this disease,'' the U.S. cabinet secretary for health, Sylvia Burwell, said on Thursday, a day after the death in Texas of the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States.
As the government prepares to start screening passengers from West Africa for fever at five major airports over the next week, cleaners at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Thursday stopped work in protest over what they say is insufficient protection for workers whose jobs include cleaning up vomit and bathrooms.
The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person, who would suffer severe bouts of vomiting and diarrhea.
"We are always with feces and near garbage,'' Sharekul Islam, 20, whose job cleaning airplane cabins at New York's John F. Kennedy airport regularly exposes him exposes him to the type of waste and fluids that can transmit Ebola.
Twenty-three Republican and three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives signed a letter to President Barack Obama asking the State Department to impose a travel ban and restrict visas issued to citizens of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In the letter, dated Oct. 8, they also asked U.S. health and border control officials to consider quarantine for anyone who arrives from the affected nations after being exposed to Ebola until 21 days have passed, the period in which they would show signs of the illness.
It said the World Health Organization "is an organization of unelected bureaucrats and political appointees of foreign countries. It has no duty to protect the lives and well-being of Americans, as you do."
Separately in Washington, Republicans in the House agreed to release $700 million more to fight Ebola from the Defense Department's request to shift $1 billion in war funds, bringing the total so far to $750 million.
U.S. health officials, while answering questions about mistakes in the treatment of Liberian man Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas and overall preparedness for Ebola patients, have emphasized the need to tackle the virus at its source in West Africa.
Ban speaks out
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the world needs a "twentyfold resource mobilization" to deal with the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
Ban spoke Thursday in Washington at the same World bank meeting as Frieden, a gathering that included high-level officials and the presidents of the hardest-hit nations -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- via videoconference.
Ban said a "surge in assistance" should include mobile labs, vehicles, helicopters, protective equipment, trained medical personnel, and medical evacuation capacities.
World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim told the group that unless the Ebola virus outbreak is contained and stopped quickly, "nothing less than the future of Africa is at stake."
Kim said there is a critical need for more trained health care workers in the affected nations.
The WHO said Ebola has killed more than 230 health workers in West African this year.
Kim said participants in Thursday's meeting will discuss what concrete actions can be taken to help the affected nations speed up efforts to fight the epidemic and temper its long-term effects on the economy.
Australia case investigated
In Australia, a nurse is undergoing medical tests after showing possible signs of Ebola, as the international community continues efforts to limit the outbreak of the virus.
Queensland state chief health officer Jeanette Young said the 57-year-old woman developed a "low-grade fever" shortly after returning from Sierra Leone, where she was working with Ebola patients.
"She came back into the country, she was perfectly well at that time. She did not have any symptoms, she did not have a fever. So it's only since this morning that she's had a low-grade fever," Young said. "She has not been out in the community in Cairns. She has been at home, isolated in her own home, testing herself."
Test results are expected to be released Friday.
Young stressed that even if the woman does have Ebola, there is no reason for the public to be concerned about an outbreak.
Spanish nurse's condition worsens
The health of a Spanish nurse with Ebola worsened on Thursday and four other people were put into isolation in Madrid, while the country's government rejected claims its methods for dealing with the disease weren't working and blamed human error.
Romero, 44, is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa, after becoming infected by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease.
In total seven people are in isolation, though only Romero has tested positive for Ebola.
The others include the nurse's husband and two doctors who cared for her. Three other people were released from the isolation unit late on Wednesday after testing negative.
A health official at the Carlos III Hospital where Romero is being treated said on Thursday: "Her clinical situation has deteriorated, but I can't give any more information due to the express wishes of the patient."
US, Britain screening
Enhanced screening for travelers from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone will begin Saturday at JFK International Airport in New York.
The screening measures will be introduced next week at four others -- Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta; Newark International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; O'Hare in Chicago; and Washington's Dulles Airport.
British officials said they will start enhanced screening of passengers arriving from West Africa at two London airports and the Eurostar train station while in Macedonia a suspected Ebola death of a British man was reported.
Macedonian hospital officials say the victim showed symptoms of Ebola, including fever, vomiting, and internal bleeding. Those who brought him to the hospital are in isolation and his Skopje hotel has been sealed off.
It is unclear if the man was in Africa before heading to Macedonia.
The WHO adjusted its number on Thursday for the total death toll in the West African Ebola outbreak, revising down its previous total by 14 after an adding error.
The WHO said 3,865 people had died by the end of Oct 5, not 3,879 as it said on Wednesday.
The figures represent the total of Ebola deaths notified by the countries hit by the virus, but the WHO says the figures are under-reported and the true totals are much higher.
Controlling the Spread of Ebola

Board Game Helps Fight Real World Ebola
LOS ANGELES —
As doctors and scientists continue to try and contain the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and find a cure, a global community of board gamers is also helping to fight this disease. The goal is to raise money to help stop the spread of Ebola.
It's a doctor’s nightmare: four disease outbreaks are exploding across the globe and spreading. Medical personnel are racing to control the epidemics and find a cure.
Fortunately, this scenario is just a board game called Pandemic. Players at GameHäus Café in the Los Angeles area are playing this game to help in the fight against Ebola.
“Despite the fact that we are enjoying ourselves and having fun playing board games, it has a connection to real world events and it is possible to make a difference doing something that you love," said Terry Chiu, one of the cafe's owners.
Pandemic game designer Matt Leacock is trying to raise $100,000 to help the international humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders fight against Ebola. One way to do this is to have “Pandemic Parties” where people get together, play the game and make a donation.
These parties are happening around the world, says Leacock in a Skype interview.
“Indonesia, Philippines, a number of them happening in Japan, South Africa, Finland. They’re just all over the place," said Leacock.
Leacock and other gamers such as Sharon Laubach have been looking for a way to help fight Ebola.
“I’ve been hearing, of course, over the summer about the devastation that Ebola has been wreaking in Africa and I think it’s really important that the board gaming community, which I know is a very generous community, to band together for this important issue," said Laubach.
These players like Pandemic because it is a cooperative game, where players take on roles, such as scientists, medics and dispatchers and work together.
Actor and gamer Rich Sommer says it is a hard game to beat.
“It’s meant to sort of remind you of the fact that people who are out there waging these real wars against disease are fighting an uphill battle. I mean it is a game and it’s abstracted, but it does, certainly gives you pause," said Sommer.
Player John Houser says this game gives him a deeper appreciation for the complexities of fighting an epidemic.
“If you play the game, you get an idea of how much… it’s more than just medical…everybody is involved," said Houser.
The four diseases in the game have no names. Game designer Leacock says in the real world, outbreaks of different diseases seem to appear every few years.
“Unfortunately it’s sort of an evergreen topic. I didn’t name the diseases in the game because you know this is something that we’re going to be fighting for some time now as a human population," he said.
The event at GameHäus Café raised more than $1,000 for Doctors Without Borders.

US Isolates Troops After Ebola Efforts in West Africa
U.S. troops returning from West Africa are being placed under isolation at a base in Italy, even though none of the soldiers has symptoms of Ebola, as a precaution to prevent the potential spread of the virus, the Pentagon said on Monday.
The U.S. Army has isolated a dozen soldiers returning from West Africa, including Major General Darryl Williams, who oversaw the military's initial response to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, the Pentagon said.
Dozens more troops would be isolated in the coming days as they rotate out of Liberia and Senegal, where the U.S. military has been building infrastructure to help health authorities treat Ebola victims, the Pentagon said.
"Out of an abundance of caution, the army directed a small number of personnel, about a dozen, that recently returned to Italy, to be monitored in a separate location at their home station of Vicenza," Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren told reporters.
“They're not allowed to leave,” Warren said, describing the precautions as “enhanced monitoring.”
In all, there are now 700 U.S. troops in West Africa, including nearly 600 in Liberia and 100 in Senegal.
The force is due to grow to at least 3,200 troops in coming weeks and possibly as large as 3,900.
'Scale of need is staggering'
Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations called attention to the need for a greater response to the Ebola outbreak that has killed nearly 5,000 people in West Africa.
Samantha Power posted on Twitter early Monday, after spending a day in Guinea, that the "scale of need is staggering" and that the "most basic resources will help save lives."
She is on a multistop tour this week of the worst-hit countries, including Sierra Leone and Liberia. She flew to Sierra Leone on Monday and will also visit Liberia, the two other countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic.
Ebola Cases and Deaths as of October 23, 2014
Power highlighted the efforts of those already working in Guinea to treat patients, build treatment facilities and educate people, including Doctors Without Borders and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
She participated by video Sunday as President Barack Obama met with his public health and national security advisers to discuss what the White House called "appropriate measure" to contain the spread of domestic Ebola cases.
UN chief blasts restrictions
The meeting follows moves by the U.S. states of New Jersey, New York and Illinois to impose mandatory 21-day quarantines on U.S. health workers who have treated Ebola patients abroad.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday blasted the latest restrictions on travelers from countries hit by the Ebola virus, saying they created difficulties for health workers who are risking their lives in the battle against the deadly disease.
Ban "believes that these restrictions have put particular pressure on health care workers and those who have been on the front line of the Ebola response," said his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric. He acknowledged to reporters that the statement covered new quarantine rules for New York and New Jersey.
"Returning health workers are exceptional people who are giving of themselves for humanity," Dujarric said, citing the views of the U.N. chief. "They should not be subjected to restrictions that are not based on science. Those who develop infections should be supported, not stigmatized."
On Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo revised that state’s quarantine policy on health care workers who return to the United States after treating Ebola patients in West Africa.
Cuomo announced that medical personnel who show no signs of the potentially fatal virus would be allowed to remain in their homes for a 21-day period, and would be monitored twice daily by other health care workers during that time.
Cuomo's revision came just two days after he and Governor Chris Christie of the neighboring state of New Jersey jointly announced a mandatory 21-day quarantine of medical personnel who had returned from working in West Africa.
Shortly after Cuomo's announcement Sunday, a spokesman for Christie released a statement, saying New Jersey's policy also allows at-home quarantines.
Elsewhere in New York, a 5-year-old boy who arrived from Guinea was being observed in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City for possible Ebola symptoms, according to media reports.
The boy, who arrived in the United States on Saturday, had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit), ABC News reported. He was not tested for the virus and was not under quarantine, ABC said, citing New York City health department officials.
The New York Post said the boy had been vomiting and was taken from his home in the Bronx by emergency medical workers.
Nurse released from quarantine
A nurse quarantined in New Jersey following exposure to Ebola has been cleared for discharge, after the governor agreed that she could finish her quarantine at home in Maine.
Christie announced on Twitter Monday that nurse Kaci Hickox does not have any symptoms of Ebola and may confine herself at home until her 21-day quarantine is complete.
Hickox returned Friday from a stint treating Ebola victims in West Africa.
She became the first person quarantined under New Jersey's new policy that requires health care workers returning from West Africa be hospitalized for 21 days upon their return. Hickox, who has tested negative for the virus, has threatened to challenge her quarantine in a lawsuit, saying it violated her constitutional rights.
A lawsuit is now unlikely, her attorney said on Monday. "She was quietly happy," said attorney Steven Hyman, who said he had spoken to the nurse by telephone. "She wants this part of her ordeal to be over. She wants to return to her life."
Called excessive
The Obama administration and medical experts have criticized the quarantines as excessive.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Sunday that the best way to protect Americans is to stop the Ebola outbreak in Africa.
Fauci said one of the best ways to do that is to help health workers who go there, rather than take measures that may discourage them from helping.
The White House said that domestic precautions must be guided by "the best medical science" rather than political considerations.
The virus has killed nearly 5,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Sierra Leone Shuts Borders, Closes Schools to Fight Ebola
FREETOWN —
Sierra Leone shut its borders to trade with Guinea and Liberia on Wednesday and closed schools, cinemas and nightclubs in a frontier region in a bid to
halt the spread of the Ebola virus.
Sixteen people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone, a figure
that has doubled in the last week, Ministry of Health figures showed.
Authorities will also mount health checkpoints in the eastern Kailahun district and mandated that all deaths there be reported before burial. Anyone who dies of the virus must be buried under the supervision of health personnel, the Information Ministry said.
The decision to close district schools came after a nine-year-old whose parents died of Ebola tested positive for the virus, Deputy Minister of Information Theo Nicol told
Reuters.
"There is more contacts between school-going kids than adults hence the closure of schools in the most affected district," he said.
The ban exempted churches and mosques but religious leaders should urge anyone with a fever to go to a clinic, he said.
Local groups welcomed the measures given public concern over the virus, which can be transmitted by touching victims or their body fluids.
The virus initially causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain and conjunctivitis, before moving to severe phases that bring on vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.
Some 328 cases and 208 deaths are linked to Ebola in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization, making the outbreak one of the deadliest for years.
More than half of new deaths in Guinea were in the southern region of Gueckedou, epicentre of the outbreak which began in February, near the Sierra Leone and Liberian borders. The town is known for its weekly market which attracts traders from
neighboring countries.

Nigeria Gripped by Massive Lassa Fever Outbreak
GENEVA —
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports it is teaming up with national and international health agencies to tackle what appears to be the largest outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria. The Latest figures show 1,081 suspected cases of the disease, including 90 deaths.
The WHO reports 317 of more than 1,000 suspected cases of Lassa fever have been confirmed during the past eight weeks. It says the number is more than the 305 cases reported all of last year, making this the biggest Lassa fever outbreak to date.
While the disease is present in 17 Nigerian states, the WHO reports it is largely concentrated in the three southern states of Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, as it is in a number of West African States. WHO spokesman Tarek Jasarevic says investigations have been undertaken to find out why this year’s outbreak is so extensive.
“[The] WHO is helping to coordinate health actors and is joining rapid risk assessment teams traveling to hot spots to investigate the outbreak. [The] WHO is supporting the Lassa fever Emergency Operations Center that is led by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to revise the Lassa fever incident Action Plan, and to strengthen surveillance, infection prevention control and treatment, as well as better coordination and conducting Lassa fever research and development,” Jasarevic said.
Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness that occurs in West Africa. The virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or feces. Jasarevic told VOA the virus also can be spread between humans.
“Once a person is infected, it can infect other people just like Ebola was through the body fluid. So, mainly that would be the health care workers who are not properly trained and who are not properly equipped who may then get infected inside the health care facilities,” Jasarevic said.
The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from six to 21 days. The WHO says the best way to prevent the disease is by promoting good community hygiene to discourage rodents that spread the disease from entering homes. Besides storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, the WHO suggests keeping cats in the home is a good idea.

Sierra Leone Nears Ebola-free Declaration
MASSESSEHBEH, SIERRA LEONE —
It had been five months since an Ebola death when Musa Kamara traveled to his hometown for festivities to mark the end of Ramadan. Not long after his sudden death in this roadside village, authorities came with a grim message: The killer virus was back.
Soon officials barricaded this community of nearly 600 people, putting up orange plastic fencing to quarantine half the town for the 21-day Ebola incubation period after potential exposure.
But late last week, residents who could only talk to family on the other side of the fence by phone erupted into song and dance when President Ernest Bai Koroma came to cut it down, marking the formal end of Sierra Leone's largest remaining quarantine.
Alie Senkoh, 21, said he couldn't wait to "move all around town" after days of playing cards and dice at home with his aunt and grandmother.
"We are feeling good because we are healthy and there is no more Ebola here," he said. "We believe this was the only way to stop the transmission."
Caution
Even amid the jubilation, there was reason for caution.
Authorities continue to monitor dozens of others who came into contact with 23-year-old Kamara, his mother and uncle, who later became infected.Both are recovering, health authorities said.
The World Health Organization announced Monday that 43 people will remain in quarantine until the end of this week, while 38 others in the capital, Freetown, where Kamara lived, must stay in quarantine until Aug. 29.
Officials desperately hope they can soon announce the start of the countdown to an Ebola-free declaration from WHO nearly 15 months after the first patient tested positive in Sierra Leone.
After the last patient is released, the country must go 42 days -- two incubation periods -- before such a declaration can be made. The benchmark already was reached in Liberia, only for that country to face a brief setback when new cases emerged.
Billboards plastered throughout Sierra Leone's capital still warn people to dial the 117 hotline to report all deaths, and others encourage families to "pray from at least one meter (yard) away" to avoid contact with highly infectious corpses.
Signs of complacency
Yet there are signs the country is starting to let down its guard.
The main road from the capital east to the second city of Bo and onwards to the town of Kenema still has more than half a dozen stopping points where passengers must undergo temperature checks.
But hand soap is no longer put out with many of the hand-washing buckets that were once so essential.
Koroma has warned Sierra Leoneans about such complacency amid the recent successes in the fight against Ebola.
During his visit to this quarantined village, he reminded people how they had made it 150 days without a case "only to return to square one" when the latest victim was buried by his family before his diagnosis of Ebola was known.
"You should report people who are sick and all dead bodies," the president urged the crowds celebrating their release.
When Kamara returned to his home village, the family did not suspect Ebola. More than two dozen of his closest relatives were considered at high risk, though only his mother and an uncle developed Ebola.
Relatives
It was a much better outcome than initially feared when it was learned he had sought treatment at two health facilities before dying -- and then had a traditional burial because the family did not think he had Ebola.
Contact with bodies has been a major source of disease transmission since the first case emerged in neighboring Guinea in late 2013.
While authorities have released most residents from quarantine, about a dozen of Kamara's relatives must remain inside their homes for another week until the incubation period has passed.
His 21-year-old sister, Mamusu Kargbo, wiped tears from her eyes as she watched jubilant neighbors bang on makeshift drums made from empty water jugs, dancing and chanting, "Now we have our freedom!"
Her brother, who sold eggs and other goods on the streets of Freetown, had been fasting for the holy month of Ramadan and said nothing about feeling unwell. Now he leaves behind a wife, a young son and other family back in his home village who counted on his remittances to eke by.
"For us it is not yet over," she said of Ebola. "We have lost our brother and this is a big change for us to accept."

Mali on High Alert as New Ebola Cases Confirmed
BAMAKO, MALI —
Mali is on high alert after authorities in Bamako confirmed the fifth case of Ebola in the country. Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita visited a treatment center Monday where the humanitarian medical group Doctors Without Borders is receiving patients.
It didn’t look good. Three people, all showing symptoms that should have led medical staff to suspect Ebola, all died at the Pasteur Clinic, one of Bamako’s best and busiest hospitals.
It wasn’t until health officials in neighboring Guinea alerted Bamako authorities that one of the deceased was an Guinean imam that the Ebola rapid response team was sent to Clinic Pasteur. The Muslim leader had traveled to the Malian capital in late October.
Active precautions
When Dr. Samba Sow, who heads the Ebola response in Mali, arrived at the clinic, he found that two of the hospitals’ staff members, a 25-year old nurse and a doctor, already were isolated after showing symptoms. Authorities immediately put the entire clinic, its staff and several patients under quarantine.
Over the weekend volunteers and medical staff searched for more than 500 people, thought to have had contact with the Imam or the nurse. The number of contacts is likely to rise in the coming days, according to Sow.
“The first day we had less than 100 contacts," he said. "Then there were 180. It rose to 442 up to now when we have identified 552 contacts. I told my team this morning to not rest until they find all of them. By the end of this week I expect we’ll have identified over 1,000 people."
The rising number of possible contacts is good news, said the doctor.
“The key to contain and fight Ebola is to find as many contacts as possible and then make sure they’re isolated and monitored,” said Sow.
From Bamako, efforts to step up Mali’s Ebola response and contain the country’s second Ebola cluster are underway.
On Monday, President Keita visited a treatment center where Doctors Without Borders is receiving and treating suspected and confirmed cases. One patient already is there, the doctor from the Pasteur Clinic.
“All measures are being put in place. We’re doing everything we can to step up efforts. I’m confident we will erase Ebola in Mali,” said the president.
Ebola warnings
The male nurse was admitted to the hospital and later died. Doctors say new cases should begin to present themselves two weeks after the male nurse was admitted. One hundred health workers and volunteers are currently looking for people thought to have had contact with the nurse in one Bamako neighborhood. Mali’s Red Cross are busy training more staff.
Many Malians are questioning the government’s response. The president is warning all Malians to take Ebola seriously.
“We know that Ebola exists. We also know that’s it’s an extremely deadly disease. It’s transmitted mainly through body fluids, such as blood, sweat and vomit. But we also know how to avoid transmission and the most important thing you can do is to wash your hands,” said Keita.
“I wash my hands several times a day, even if I’m wearing rubber gloves,” the president continued.
For nearly a year, Mali was spared the virus now blamed for killing more than 5,000 people in the region, despite the fact that the country shares a porous border with Guinea where the epidemic started in December last year.
Now there are at least five confirmed cases of Ebola and four deaths linked to the hemorrhagic fever. Hundreds of people have been placed under quarantine, including at least 20 members of the U.N. peacekeeping force who were treated at the Bamako hospital where the deceased nurse worked.

West Africa Battles Worst Ever Ebola Outbreak
The rapidly spreading Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the deadliest ever, health officials say.
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have reported hundreds of cases since March this year and more than 1,000 deaths. Nigeria is on high alert after the first known case was reported in Lagos.
As of July 20, some 1,093 people in the region have been infected, according to the World Health Organization. At least 660 of those people have died.
Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, is bracing for an outbreak after a Liberian man hospitalized with Ebola in Lagos died last week. Liberia is closing most of its borders.
The Nigerian government is currently working to identify every person who came into contact with Patrick Sawyer during his journey from Liberia to Nigeria early last week. Sawyer, 40, was a consultant for the country's finance ministry and he was immediately quarantined in Lagos upon arrival.
But State Heath Commissioner Jide Idris says many more people may have had contact with Sawyer than is currently known. According to Idris, the first plane Sawyer traveled on stopped briefly in Ghana before going on to Togo, where he switched planes. He said the airline has not provided a manifest for the first two flights.
Both the Nigerian health and aviation departments are still searching, but so far, Idris said they are not aware of any other potential Ebola cases.
“We call on all Nigerians to be calm and not to panic and do hereby ensure them that both the state and the federal government are up in arms to ensure that the virus does not escape and that no Nigerian is infected with this virus," he said.
Doctor infected
Ebola cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as of July 24, 2014.
“Ebola is an incredibly dangerous, deadly disease,” noted Melissa Strickland, spokesperson for the international relief group Samaritan’s Purse, one of whose medical doctors was struck down with the illness while caring for patients at a facility in Liberia.
“Just a little while ago, Dr. Kent Brantly’s condition was stable,” she said. “His fever is fluctuating. He has body aches, pains, the typical Ebola symptoms. He’s receiving intensive medical care from our team on the ground and we are hopeful for his recovery.”
Kent Brantly, 33, contracted the disease despite taking every precaution against it.
“Our medical personnel follow very strict protocols that were devised by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization,” Strickland said. “When they treat patients, not an inch of their body is uncovered. They are fully covered in personal protection equipment.
Virus origins
The first recognized cases of Ebola were identified in 1976, in Sudan and former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Humans become infected with Ebola by close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.
Fruit bats are believed to be the natural reservoirs of the virus, which means that they carry the virus but don’t become infected themselves. Ebola has also been found in found in a number of African monkeys, chimpanzees and other primates in areas where so-called “bush meat” is part of the diet.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working together to help educate rural populations about the risks of hunting wildlife.
“We are not suggesting that people stop hunting altogether, which isn’t realistic,” said FAO Chief Veterinary Officer Juan Lubroth in a recent statement.

“But communities need clear advice on the need not to touch dead animals or to sell or eat the meat of any animal that they find already dead. They should also avoid hunting animals that are sick or behaving strangely, as this is another red flag," he said.
Ebola can also be contracted by contact with bodily fluids of patients, which is why health care workers, traditional healers and family members are at increased risk. Victims of the disease are still highly contagious after the death, and health workers are warning families against traditional burial practices, such as washing the body or touching it before burial.
According to the WHO, symptoms of the virus show up anywhere from two to 21 days of being exposed to the virus. They experience fever, extreme weakness and body aches, headache, diarrhea and vomiting. Chest pain, skin rashes, mental confusion and jaundice (yellow skin) can also occur.
Patients are contagious only after they begin to show symptoms. Health workers will confirm an ebola diagnosis through blood tests that measure white blood cells, platelet counts, and liver enzymes.
Guarding against Ebola
“There’s no cure, there’s no medication that you can give to actually deal with the virus itself,” Strickland said. “But what we can do is keep the patient hydrated, as comfortable as possible and as supported as possible medically to give them the best fighting chance against the disease.”
Ebola is fatal in 90 percent of the cases, though chances for survival increase with early diagnosis.
Because no treatment or vaccine exists, avoiding contamination is the best way to stop the spread of the illness. That includes avoiding sick or dead animals, especially primates; washing hands frequently; and alerting health care workers if infection is suspected.
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf shut down most of Liberia’s borders Sunday, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the Ebola, and all public gatherings have been banned in that country. Airports in the capital, Monrovia, and three major Liberian border crossings are also screening travelers.
The CDC has issued no travel restrictions for passengers to West Africa, but recommends that international visitors practice careful hygiene, avoid contact with the blood and/or body fluids of severely ill people, avoid animals and seek health care if they develop fever or other flu-like symptoms.

Liberia Days Away From Being Ebola-Free, Official Says
GENEVA —
Liberia’s minister of commerce and industry says Liberia has had no new cases of Ebola for a while and is near the point at which it can be declared Ebola-free.
"May 9 is our magic date," Minister Axel Addy said. "If there are no new cases, and I believe there will be no new cases, we will have met the threshold. Some of the Ebola treatment centers have actually been decommissioned, and there are others that are being decommissioned.”
Addy told VOA that the government knows Ebola could recur and is putting in place a management system to deal with another emergency, should it arise.
“It includes putting in place the right health infrastructure to deal with the response, to track any sort of new potential cases and to monitor what is happening along the borders,” he said.
Besides strengthening its health system and protecting its people from the possibility of a new outbreak of this deadly disease, Liberia is faced with the huge task of reviving its economy. Before Ebola struck, Liberia was projecting a 2014 gross domestic product growth rate of between 5.9 and 7 percent. After the crisis hit, GDP dipped to below 1 percent.
Augustine Jarret, Liberia's minister of state without portfolio, said the Ebola crisis has had a cascading effect on all aspects of the economy, especially on Liberia’s two main products, rubber and iron ore. He said companies closed, thousands of people lost their jobs and farms became idle, stripping thousands of farmers of their income.
He said it was clear that Liberia cannot remain dependent on two products and must diversify into other areas. He said Liberia plans to put more emphasis on working with the private sector as opposed to the government side.
“Most of what we have seen in many, many decades before is that most of the people who work in Liberia work in the government sector, and that is going to change," Jarret said. "Our focus is on the private sector — private-sector jobs, private-sector investments, and trying to move the economy in the direction where private sector players are the drivers of our economic growth and vitality.”
The Liberian ministers said they were working hard to attract private investment to help build up infrastructure and to revive major road, bridge and other construction projects that had stopped during the Ebola epidemic.
They noted that a lot of money and work would be expended on reviving the agriculture sector, in which 70 percent of the labor force is employed.

Demolitions in Sierra Leone Stir Controversy
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE —
Juliana Sesay is among the thousands of sierra Leoneans affected by recently massive government-led demolitions around the capital, Freetown.
The 23-year-old Ebola survivor was living in an area known as Tambakula village, a fisherman’s wharf with shops that some people, like Sesay, also used as homes.
The entire area, population 500, was demolished several weeks ago, and now she’s staying with a friend and sleeping in a room with three other adults, two toddlers and two babies.
This is not how she pictured her life after recovering from the deadly disease that has killed more than 11,000 people across West Africa.
"I’m feeling scared," she said. "After they demolished the place I just say, 'I want to kill myself,' because I don't know where to start.”
Without offers of help or compensation for the destruction of her home, Sesay, like many around the capital, worries about how she will get by.
Since demolishing a wide section of Freetown, the government, which had warned residents about the plans for years, has forced many people into homelessness. While government officials have said residents of the targeted demolition sites were there illegally, human rights groups are concerned. They say the destruction is leaving the most vulnerable at much greater risk in the midst of an Ebola crisis.
Aside from several poor communities, an entire side of the main beach road, where restaurants and bars once stood, was recently razed. Government officials say the area needed to cleaned up and made more appealing to tourists.
“The last three years, there have been meetings where they’ve [the government] told local chiefs around the area that these people don’t belong here," deputy government spokesman Agibu Jalloh said.
According to Solomon Sogbandi, director of Amnesty International in Sierra Leone, the government's good intentions have been poorly executed, doing more harm than good.
“Why not look at an alternative sort of housing for these people?" he said. "Relocate them somewhere. If you just evict them forcefully, it has other human rights implications.”
And health implications. Sogbandi says it’s still rainy season and this can make people more prone to diseases like malaria if they don’t have proper shelter.
Although Jalloh says people were offered land elsewhere a couple of years ago, some residents did go but kept coming back.
Former residents say they have not been offered any help.

UN Expanding Ebola Response to Mali
UNITED NATIONS —
The United Nations secretary-general said Friday that he will open a branch of the special U.N. mission to fight Ebola in Mali, which has had six fatal cases of the virus in recent weeks.
Ban Ki-moon spoke in Washington, where he went for talks on Ebola with the head of the World Bank and the chief of the World Health Organization.
He said that while there has been progress in fighting the outbreak in West Africa, results have been uneven and the recent emergence of a handful of cases in Mali is of particular concern.
Ban announced that he had spoken with Mali’s president and that the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response [UNMEER] would urgently establish an office in Mali.
“Decisive national action combined with international support today will help to prevent a spread of the outbreak in Mali to crisis proportions tomorrow,” he said.
Ban said he was immediately dispatching to Bamako the head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Margaret Chan, and the chief of UNAIDS, Michel Sidibé, to conduct intensive discussions on how the U.N. system can help stop Ebola in Mali.
Chan said some 500 people are being monitored for signs of the virus in Mali. They came into contact with an imam from Guinea who traveled to Bamako for treatment and then died of the disease. She cautioned against complacency in the region.
"Yes we are seeing some early signals of hope, cases are stabilizing, but as Mr. Secretary-General was saying, we are also seeing some new areas where they are reporting new cases. So the answer is we must maintain our vigilance, complacency would be our enemy," said Chan.
New cases slowing
As of November 19, WHO said there have been 15,145 cases of the virus, which has hemorrhagic fever-like symptoms, and 5,420 deaths. The majority of cases have been in three West African countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Ban said where the Ebola response strategy has been implemented, the rate of new cases appears to be slowing.
“If we continue to accelerate our response, we can contain and end the outbreak by the middle of next year,” said Ban.
Significant expense
In New York, during a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on the Ebola response, the U.N. system coordinator for Ebola, Dr. David Nabarro, said the U.N. will need $1.5 billion through March 2015 to cover the response effort. Currently, there is a $600-million shortfall.
Nabarro told reporters the U.N. is making progress in reaching goals to stop the spread of Ebola.
“I think we are pretty confident that the 70 percent safe burials is probably, in most places now, being achieved. The 70 percent of people with Ebola under treatment -- we are moving rapidly in that direction; I can’t say at this stage whether or not we will reach it," said Nabarro. "So confident, no, but very pleased with the way in which things have advanced on access to treatment, yes.”
Council members expressed their support for UNMEER, their concern about the extent of the Ebola outbreak, including in Mali and thanked countries for their contributions.
Earlier Friday, the WHO said the death toll in the Ebola epidemic had risen to 5,459 out of more than 15,000 cases. The cases are in eight countries, with the majority in three West African nations -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It cautions, though, that the number of cases and deaths continue to be underreported, and said Friday that DRC health officials remain on high alert for the disease.
Also Friday, the WHO declared an end to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The outbreak -- unrelated to the one affecting West Africa -- was centered in Congo's northwestern Equateur province and killed at least 49 people.
The WHO released a statement Friday saying it has been 42 days, or twice the maximum incubation period, since a new case of Ebola has been detected in the DRC. The WHO declaration confirms a statement by the DRC government last week that the outbreak there is over.
Meanwhile, a Cuban doctor who contracted Ebola arrived Friday for treatment in Switzerland, where doctors say he is in stable condition.
The Ebola virus was first discovered in the DRC in 1976, when the country was known as Zaire, and is named after a river in northern Congo.

Liberia Fires Officials for Not Returning to Fight Ebola
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has fired 10 senior officials who defied an order to return to the country and help in the fight against Ebola.
The officials, including assistant ministers, deputy ministers and commissioners, had been told in August come back to Liberia.
The African country has been hit hard by an Ebola outbreak, which has claimed more than 2,400 lives in West Africa.
The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders has called the situation in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea catastrophic because the countries' healthsystems cannot deal with the large number of Ebola patients. The virus also has killed many qualified medical workers, causing a shortage in the most affected countries.
Officials in Sierra Leone confirmed Sunday that a fourth doctor had died from the disease.
They said Olivette Buck died hours after the World Health Organization said it would not be able to evacuate her to Germany for treatment. The organization had instead offered to give her the best care possible in Sierra Leone, including possible access to experimental drugs.
Sierra Leone's chief medical officer, Brima Kargbo, told the French News Agency that the health ministry is deeply grieved to lose another devoted Ebola fighter.
President Barack Obama is scheduled to travel Tuesday to the Center for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta to be briefed about the Ebola outbreak and to discuss the U.S. response to the epidemic.
U.S. government contributions toward fighting the outbreak have topped $100 million. The private Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation this week pledged $50 million to purchase supplies and speed up development of potential therapies.

Liberia's Last 2 Ebola Patients Recover, Leave Hospital
MONROVIA —
Liberia released its last two known Ebola cases from the hospital Thursday as it starts a new countdown to declaring itself free of the virus for a third time, health officials said.
Liberia had been the only country in West Africa with known cases. Neighbor Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free in November, while Guinea's last known case recovered two weeks ago.
"There are no cases in the ETUs [Ebola Treatment Units] in the entire Republic of Liberia," said Tolbert Nyenswah, head of Liberia's Ebola response, adding that Ebola safety procedures remained in place.
The two patients released from the Paynesville ETU are the father and younger brother of the presumed index case, a 15-year-old boy named Nathan Gbotoe from a suburb of the capital Monrovia who died from the disease last week.
However, new cases could emerge in Liberia since there are 165 contacts still under quarantine, of whom more than 30 are deemed high risk, health officials told Reuters.
The contacts under surveillance have completed 14 days of their obligatory 21-day monitoring — a period that corresponds with the typical incubation period of the virus, Nyenswah said.
"No need to cancel your plane ticket when you are planning to come to Liberia. Continue to come here; the place is safe," Nyenswah told reporters.
Liberian medical workers are still grappling to explain how Ebola re-emerged in Liberia more than two months after it was declared free of the virus by the World Health Organization.
Resurgent cases in Liberia, possibly transmitted sexually by survivors, has cast doubt on the current policy of labelling a country Ebola-free after 42 days.

Fear Is Important Factor in Response to Ebola, IS Beheadings
While terrorist beheadings, the Ebola epidemic and immigration were on the minds of many Americans this year, the way they were covered by U.S. media and hyped in campaign ads prompted commentators to wonder whether the country has been overcome by fear.
"It is especially disturbing, that a nation like the United States, which is unprecedented in its power, unprecedented in its resources, can live in such a fearful state," said Rev. Gene Robinson, a retired Episcopal bishop who is now a fellow at the Center for American Progress.
In a column he writes regularly for The Daily Beast online magazine, he decried the “pandemic of fear” that preceded the midterm elections in November.
Political candidates often play up public fears to get elected, and this year attack ads showed Ebola workers in hazmat suits, immigrants attempting to cross the Mexican frontier under the cover of darkness and the beheadings of journalists and humanitarians by Islamic militants in the Middle East.
"Evil forces around the world want to harm Americans every day," an ominous voice began one ad in a congressional race in the border state of Arizona.
Deseret News of Salt Lake City, Utah, suggested that media coverage had made Americans overly afraid.
It cited a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute which found that one-third of respondents were "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned" that they or someone in their family could be harmed by terrorists.
"The likelihood of being a victim of a terrorist attack is fairly slim, statistically speaking," PRRI researcher Daniel Cox was quoted as saying. "But that doesn't mean that fear is any less palpable."
The response to the Ebola scare was a topic of conversation at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association, held in Washington, DC in early December.
Doug Henry, a medical anthropologist at the University of North Texas, said the quarantines imposed on aid workers returning from helping Ebola patients in Africa, “weren’t exactly governed by science.”
By contrast, he said, fear has been harnessed as a positive force in public health in campaigns against smoking and distracted driving.
"What we have seen from this epidemic is that if you have just fear, and just fear messaging, in the absence of any self-efficacy messaging - in other words, messaging that shows people how to handle a response - it can actually have maladaptive social behaviors - driving the epidemic underground, mass panic, hysteria."
Fear has played a role before in American politics. In his 1933 inaugural address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared:
"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!"
But media observers said the hyperintensive, self-reinforcing style of coverage common today on news shows was having a magnifying effect.
"Have you been paying attention to the news lately?” comedian Jon Stewart, who skewers American media coverage in his Daily Show, asked in October.
“You might have heard: we are all going to die!"
Gregory Button, a disaster researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who was also at the anthropological conference, sees no evidence that Americans were any more concerned about these threats than in previous years.
“There’s always a level of uncertainty and fear in any culture,” he said. “It’s a constant that we live with on an everyday level.”
A former journalist, Button says the threats are “a cultural construct.” He points out that number of deaths they have caused in the United States is dwarfed by traffic accidents, which kill more Americans every two years than died in the entire Vietnam War.
"Cultures selectively choose which social problems they are going to focus on,” he said, adding: “Sometimes it seems irrational."

G20 Nations Pledge to Boost Global Economy
Leaders of the G-20, representing the world's largest advanced and developing economies, adopted a plan to boost global economic growth by more than $2 trillion over five years, by investing in infrastructure and increasing free trade.
As the G-20 summit ended Sunday in Brisbane, the international leaders also pledged cooperation for strong action against climate change and support for an international response to the Ebola breakout in West Africa.
U.S. President Barack Obama said policies adopted by the G-20 could add 100 million jobs for women over the next decade and stiffen regulation of global corporations.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said nations will hold each other accountable by monitoring implementation of their commitments to boost growth.
"This year, the G-20 has delivered real, practical outcomes and, because of the efforts that the G-20 has made, this year, culminating in the last 48 hours, people right around the world are going to be better off and that's what it's all about,” Abbott said.
'American leadership'
Obama is facing contentious fights with opposition Republican lawmakers in Washington over immigration and construction of an oil pipeline through the central U.S. But he said the past week he spent in the Asian-Pacific region proved to be a "strong week for American leadership."
He said headway that was made will mean more jobs for Americans, steps toward a cleaner and healthier planet and progress toward saving lives, not just in West Africa, but elsewhere.
The G-20, which represents 85 percent of the global economy, has been plagued by weak growth in Europe, which could record its third recession in six years, as well as in China and Japan, the world's second and third biggest economies after the U.S.

US Nurses Strike Over Lack of Ebola Safeguards
Nurses across the United States are planning a national day of action Wednesday to demand better protection and training against Ebola.
Up to 18,000 nurses went on strike Tuesday in the western state of California, protesting what they said was a lack of optimal safeguards against the disease.
The two-day walkout targets hospitals and clinics belonging to U.S. health care giant Kaiser Permanente. The nurses' union has been in contract talks with Kaiser since July.
Kaiser, meanwhile, said it has been preparing its staff for Ebola. The company said calling a strike now, during flu season and when the nation is concerned about the risk of Ebola, "seems particularly irresponsible."
But the nurses said their focus was on the erosion of patient care standards.
Nurses nationwide will join the California employees Wednesday in their call for better protocols.
Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, the organization behind the day of action, said that when it comes to Ebola, "the message nurses are being given across the nation is that they are expendable. ... You don't ask nurses to put their lives on the line and then not protect them."
National Nurses United is calling for "rigorous training" for all caregivers who might interact with Ebola patients. It says they should be provided with full-body hazardous-materials suits and other appropriate protective equipment.
Ebola fears spread in the U.S. last month when two nurses contracted Ebola at a Texas hospital after treating a Liberian man who died of the disease. Both women have since recovered.

Liberia Investigates How Latest Ebola Patient Got Infected
MONROVIA —
Liberian officials were investigating Saturday how the country's latest Ebola patient became infected, after weeks with no cases of the disease in the country.
Liberia has seen the most deaths in the Ebola outbreak, with more than 4,200 of the more than 10,000 dead across West Africa.
Since Liberia discharged its last case on March 5, it was counting down the 42 days that a country must wait in order to be declared Ebola-free. But on Friday, officials said a new patient tested positive.
In a worrying sign, she doesn't seem to be linked to any of the people on an Ebola contacts list and said she has not traveled recently to the neighboring infected countries of Sierra Leone and Guinea, said Dr. Francis Kateh, acting head of the Liberia Ebola Case Management Team.
Kateh said authorities were considering the possibility that she had a visitor from outside Liberia who infected her or that she had sex with a survivor. The Ebola virus can be found in the semen of survivors for up to three months, and health authorities recommend that survivors abstain from sex during that period.
"The key thing is, if there is any transmission out there, how can we break this transmission?" he asked.
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is calling the investigation team every half-hour or so to check in, Kateh said.
Authorities are still compiling a list of people who came into contact with the patient, said Elizabeth Hamann of the International Rescue Committee, which is helping to manage the hospital where the woman first sought care. Contacts of people who are sick with Ebola must be monitored for symptoms.
Although hopes were high that Liberia had beaten Ebola, officials know that until neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea also stamp out the disease, Liberia will remain at risk.

As Ebola Caseload Declines, Focus Shifts
Efforts to slow the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola are shifting to a focus on ending the epidemic and rebuilding the three West African countries that it has devastated.
The World Health Organization said Thursday that the number of new cases fell to its lowest weekly level since June. A total of 99 new cases were reported last week among Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to WHO figures.
Sierra Leone saw a huge reduction with 65 new cases last week, compared to 117 the week before and 184 three weeks ago.
In Liberia, where the Ebola outbreak peaked much earlier, there were four new cases last week, down from a high of 300 per week in August and September.
The WHO said in the new "second phase" of its response, officials will stop working to rapidly build facilities and focus instead on efforts to find infected people, manage their cases, engage with communities and ensure proper burials.
Reconstruction meeting planned
U.N. Ebola coordinator David Nabarro also said governments and international organizations plan to meet in March to set a course for rebuilding the three countries.
"The plans at the moment are for a conference to look at the needs of reconstruction," Nabarro said, adding it would be "organized by the countries themselves," plus the United Nations, the African Union and European Union.
Nabaro, who's attending the African Union summit in Addis Ababa, told Reuters the meeting likely would take place March 3 in Brussels. By then, he anticipates "estimates for what the whole recovery and revival will cost," he said.
Earlier this month, the World Bank projected the three countries would lose $1.6 billion in income, more than 12 percent of their combined economic output, Reuters said.
The United Nations has received commitments for about $500 million of the $1.5 billion it will need to respond to the crisis this year, Nabarro said. "We will need more for the response, but also there will be funding needed for reconstruction."
While the Ebola epidemic is decreasing, Nabarro warned that the disease remains present in a third of the areas of the three nations.
"The number of cases is decreasing week by week and getting to zero in many places ... but we still see occasional flare-ups and we still see some surprises with new cases out of our contact lists," Nabarro told the French news agency AFP.
"That means that the epidemic is not contained yet," he said, adding that the upcoming rainy season is cause for concern.
'Dangerous situation'
Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is leading WHO's Ebola response, sounded a similar warning.
"This is like being in bed with two cobras, and one of them is dead," Aylward told The Associated Press. "You still have an incredibly dangerous situation." He added that Ebola outbreaks often come in waves.
Speaking at a WHO Ebola meeting last Sunday, Jerome Oberreit, secretary general of Doctors Without Borders, said there is virtually no sharing of Ebola information about the risks of cases crossing the borders among the three countries in West Africa.
Oberreit said surveillance teams lack even basic resources to track down Ebola patients and blamed "international negligence" for the inability to contain the outbreak.
The U.N.'s Nabarro said there were key lessons from the response to Ebola. A proposal to set up an African equivalent to the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would be a step forward, he said.
"It took us too long to be ready. We need a better response capacity," Nabarro said.
The 54-member African Union will meet in Ethiopia on Friday and Saturday. Representatives are set to discuss the CDC center, which in its initial phase would operate as an early warning system. They'll also discuss Ebola-affected countries' economic recovery, as well as establishment of a "solidarity fund."
Through January 25, there were more than 22,000 total suspected and confirmed cases since the outbreak began in December 2013. About 8,800 people have died.
Some material for this report came from AP, AFP and Reuters.

W. African Ebola Epidemic ‘Out of Control,’ Aid Group Says
ACCRA, GHANA —
An Ebola epidemic in West Africa is out of control and requires massive resources from governments and aid agencies to prevent it from spreading further, the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres / Doctors Without Borders said Monday.
Since February, a combined 337 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the U.N. World Health Organization said last week, making this the deadliest outbreak since Ebola first emerged in 1976. Patients have been identified in more than 60 locations across the three countries, making it harder to curb the outbreak.
Ebola previously has not occurred in the region. It has frightened local residents, who view health facilities with suspicion. This makes it harder to control the disease’s spread, the MSF charity said in a statement.
A lack of understanding has meant people continue to prepare corpses and attend funerals of Ebola victims, leaving them vulnerable to the disease, transmitted by touching victims or through bodily fluids, MSF said.
Civil society groups, governments and religious authorities have also failed to acknowledge the scale of the epidemic and as a result few prominent figures are promoting the fight against the disease, the statement said.
"The epidemic is out of control,'' said Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. "With the appearance of new sites in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, there is a real risk of it spreading to other areas."
"Ebola is no longer a public health issue limited to Guinea: It is affecting the whole of West Africa,"' said Janssens, urging WHO, affected countries and their neighbors to deploy more resources especially trained medical staff.
MSF has treated some 470 patients, 215 of them confirmed cases, in specialized centers in the region. But the organization said it had reached its capacity.
Ebola, fatal in up to 90 percent of cases, has no vaccine and no known cure. The virus initially causes raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and weakness before moving into more severe phases with vomiting, diarrhea and hemorrhages.

Mozambique Steps Up to Challenge of Health Information Dissemination
MAPUTO/XINAVANE/XIA XIA, MOZAMBIQUE —
With more than half of the population illiterate and its people speaking more than 40 local languages, Mozambique faces colossal challenges in disseminating health information to its population. As the country rolls out new national health campaigns, communication experts are becoming savvier about how they reach Mozambicans.
Fourteen-year-old Fernando emerges from the mobile male circumcision unit in Xinavane, casually pulling his shirt collar up to his ears, giving his approving friends a confident nod. It is a swift procedure, which could help reduce the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases and HIV in Mozambique.
But male circumcision is a hard sell.
Posters dot the mobile unit where nurses carry out around 50 male circumcisions a day. They carry messages such as “I was fearful but I made the right decision," and “Get circumcised and use a condom.”
Boys waiting in line say they learned about the benefits of circumcision from teachers, or their mothers took them after hearing about it from their friends and traditional community leaders.
And community leaders are key in getting out health messages says Patrick Devos, a communications expert who works with non-profit groups and the Mozambican Health Ministry.
“We believe that for real behavioral change, communication has to happen in a community dialogue. We found in formative research that ‘I feel clean,’ ‘I feel healthy, more attractive’ - these kind of things are appealing to younger men… It is about going out, talking to people, having all these focus group discussions. We then try to tailor our messages around things that might appeal to them," said Devos.
Posters and illustrated flip-charts explaining male circumcision, HIV and malaria are devised and pre-tested in coalition with communities to create effective messaging based on language and imagery they understand. In a country where a storytelling tradition is strong, video and audio testimonies have proved to be extremely powerful in facilitating debate and triggering social change, says Devos.
“These days, the reach of television has really grown dramatically but still radio is extremely powerful especially if you can translate your spots into local languages," he said.
Community radio is pivotal in conveying health messages in a country where the Internet is accessed by only 5 percent of the population and more than half the population is illiterate. About 50 percent of Mozambicans have access to a television set but more than 90 percent have access to radio.
Print journalism lacks the dynamism to tackle health issues in-depth, say health groups. Circulation is limited to the southern urban cities and journalists are rarely assigned to cover health care.
A community radio station in Xai Xai, over 200 kilometers from the capital, reaches roughly 3,500 people in a 70-kilometer radius. Here they recruit volunteers as radio presenters due to limited resources. Program coordinator Teresa Zita says radio dramas with health messages and lengthy debates where people can send a text message or speak to a health expert are part of their regular programming.
“We organize different types of debates. For example, next week we will be talking about the Ebola virus and we invite medical practitioners to come and talk about the issue. People call and ask how do you know for example that you have cervical cancer and other types of question. The medical practitioners, sometimes they even leave booklets with information so we can keep on informing the listeners," said Zita.
Across town in Xai-Xai, women look amusedly at the teams of people suited up in beige overalls with a matching hood tasked with going door-to-door as part of an initiative led by the Center for Disease Control and the government. The initiative involves spraying insecticide on the interior walls of homes to kill and deter mosquitoes, and cut down on malaria.
The strange suits give credence to the information teams, who have been chosen from the communities to disseminate information about residual spraying, while familiarizing people with what the technicians will look like when they come to spray homes.
Although it is arduous and time-consuming, many health projects are finding that the door-to-door approach ensures that those beyond the reach of traditional media receive vital, life-saving information.

US Ebola Fears Spread Faster Than Virus
For Americans, Ebola started out as a disease in a far away continent, but then a man from Liberia died from Ebola in a Dallas hospital, and things changed.
Ebola was on American soil. Fears heightened, and they spiked even more when two nurses who treated that Ebola patient contracted the disease.
These new cases have prompted an epidemic of fear.
One of the nurses, Nina Pham, was transferred from a Dallas hospital to the clinical studies unit at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.
Efforts to allay fears
A top official there, Dr. Anthony Fauci, sought to allay fears at a news conference Friday morning.
"We fully intend to have this patient walk out of this hospital. And we intend to do everything we can to make that happen," Fauci said.
The other nurse, Amber Vinson, has been moved to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.
Despite assurances from America's top doctors, more than 80 percent of Americans believe Ebola can be spread by many ways, including by sneezing and coughing. Those are the results of a new poll by Harvard University.
Infectious disease experts say the virus can only be spread by contact with bodily fluids from someone who has the disease.
The poll also shows that more than half of adults are concerned that there will be a large outbreak of Ebola inside the U.S. within the next 12 months.
Health-care workers concerned
Nurses and doctors are also raising their concerns.
Nurses' groups say they haven't been trained to care for Ebola patients and that they don't have proper equipment to protect them from catching the virus. Randi Weingarten heads one of the nurses unions.
"Frontline providers, who are key to containing Ebola, must have a voice and be involved in the development and implementation of plans," Weingarten said.
On Saturday, President Barack Obama used his weekly address to tell Americans keep the situation in perspective and not to give in to Ebola "hysteria or fear."
Many Americans are calling for a ban on travel to the U.S. from West African nations affected by Ebola until the virus is under control.
But that would prevent the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from screening and tracking these visitors. That's what CDC head Dr. Thomas Frieden, told a congressional hearing on Thursday.
"Borders can be porous. We won't be able to check them for fever when they leave. We won't be able to check them for fever when they arrive. When they arrive we wouldn't be able to impose quarantine," Frieden told members of a House subcommittee.
Still, a plane that one of the infected nurses flew on is now being disinfected and schools in Ohio and Texas closed their doors because some students or staff shared an airplane with the nurse, unnecessary procedures prompted by fear because experts say you can only get Ebola from a sick person's bodily fluids.

Liberia Medical Workers Threaten Strike
Medical workers in Liberia are set to go on strike over a pay dispute, a move that could deliver a serious blow to the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.
Thousands of members of Liberia's National Health Workers Association said they will not report for work on Monday unless they receive a substantial increase in hazard pay.
Members of the association are demanding $700 in monthly hazard pay on top of monthly salaries that are around $200 or $300.
Liberia has the highest number of infections and deaths in the worst outbreak of the illness. Ebola has killed more than 2,300 people in the poor West African nation.
Obama calls for action
President Barack Obama called for immediate steps to ensure the U.S. medical system is ready to follow the proper protocol for treating Ebola patients.
Obama spoke Sunday with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell about the first case of Ebola transmission in the United States.
Obama ordered the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to quickly investigate how a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital contracted the virus.
The nurse was part of the team treating the first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in the United States, Thomas Duncan, who died last week.
Texas officials say the health worker wore full protective gear and complied with CDC guidelines when she had contact with Duncan.
Breach of protocol
CDC Director Tom Frieden said the fact the worker was infected with Ebola shows there was a breach of protocol.
Frieden said, at this time, it appears only one person may have had contact with the health care worker while she may have been infectious. However, the case in Texas indicated a professional lapse that may have caused other health workers at the hospital to also be infected, he added.
Initial testing showed that the level of virus in the worker's system is low. The CDC will conduct a secondary test to confirm the results from a lab in Austin that showed Ebola infection, he said.
“Unfortunately it is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola,” Frieden added.
A union for registered nurses said the Texas health care worker's case in Dallas showed that not enough is being done to educate health workers on how to manage patients who show signs of infection.
“Handing out a piece of paper with a link to the Centers for Disease Control, or telling nurses just to look at the CDC website - as we have heard some hospitals are doing - is not preparedness,” said Bonnie Castillo, a registered nurse and senior official with National Nurses United.
Teresa Romero, the Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola, is seen inside her room at an isolation ward on the sixth floor at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, Oct. 11, 2014.
Meanwhile, in Spain, authorities said a woman in Madrid infected with Ebola remains in serious condition, but is showing signs of slight improvement and that the level of virus in her blood is decreasing.
US airport screenings
The new U.S. case comes as several airports begin a stepped-up program to screen passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where thousands of people have died from the virus.
Authorities at New York's JFK International Airport are taking passengers' temperatures and asking them questions to determine whether they may have come into contact with an infected person.
The enhanced screening will expand to four other airports Thursday, including the Newark airport in New Jersey, Washington's Dulles Airport, Chicago's O'Hare and the international airport in Atlanta.
Together, the five airports receive more than 90 percent of all travelers entering the United States from the three worst-affected West African countries.
Britain is also introducing Ebola screening at certain airports and train stations.
The World Health Organization says the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 4,000 people with about 8,400 reported cases.
Outside of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, eight people died in Nigeria and one patient died in the United States.
Some information for this report was provided by AP and Reuters.

West Africa Health Ministers to Meet Over Ebola Strategy
Regional health ministers from the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] will evaluate the implementation of strategic plans aimed at combating Ebola at a meeting in Ghana’s capital, Accra, this weekend, according to Haruna Warkani, acting ECOWAS communications director.
He said the regional group is working closely with member countries battling the disease including Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, as well as its international health partners.
Warkani said the regional health ministers, who recently met in Accra, outlined strategic plans to contain and subsequently eradicate the disease.
“Another meeting is scheduled in Accra as a follow up… which would include West African health institutions… [and] other international development institutions like the World Health Organization and the United Nations. [They] have been very much involved in looking for [a] common solution to [Ebola],” said Warkani.
The World Health Organization reports the current Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa is 6,263 confirmed cases with 2,917 deaths.
Critics have accused ECOWAS of reacting too slowly since the first cases were reported in Guinea.
Warkani disagreed, saying the regional bloc has been performing its functions as a coordinating body. He said ECOWAS has been helping member states in that capacity, and also working to create international attention about the challenges member states face in fighting the outbreak.
“These criticisms are surely unfounded, because it is a disease that suddenly came up upon the populations of the sub-region. So to say ECOWAS has not done anything, it will be difficult to justify that kind of position,” said Warkani. “ECOWAS has successfully rally round [the] international community to understand what is going on and seek for help anywhere because it is beyond the sub-region to contain this scourge.”
He said ECOWAS has to be praised for its work to help contain the disease.
“The sub-region needs to be commended even for the containment effort so far recorded, because except for one or two [countries], the spread is definitely almost under control today, and this is as a result of the interest generated at the international scene,” said Warkani.

African Health Ministers Meet to Address Ebola Outbreak
Health ministers from 11 African nations are meeting Wednesday in Ghana to discuss how they should respond to the deadliest ever outbreak of Ebola.
The World Health Organization is leading the two-day conference in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, after announcing that 467 people have now died from Ebola in West Africa this year.
Guinea has been the hardest hit with 303 deaths attributed to Ebola since April. The overall numbers are lower in Sierra Leone and Liberia, but both countries have reported a sharp increase in cases and deaths from the highly contagious disease in the past month.
The other countries taking part in the conference include Ivory Coast, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Senegal, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The WHO is calling for a "strong response" to contain the outbreak, particularly in the area where Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border.
Before this year, the deadliest Ebola outbreak was in 1976 in the DRC where 280 people died.
The often-fatal disease is spread between humans by direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids from an infected person. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for Ebola.

Sierra Leone Ebola Survivors Help Train Health Care Workers
FREETOWN —
Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone are helping to train health care workers by showing them what to expect when dealing with Ebola patients. The training is a partnership between the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the World Health Organization and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation.
The training takes place in a stadium downtown. A mock hospital has been set up so people get a real sense of being at work
Some Ebola survivors find great comfort in a song they wrote thanking God they are still alive. They sing it when they meet for a panel discussion with health care workers going through training.
Marina Sheriff is one of those people. She caught Ebola from a local doctor.
Speaking in her native Krio language, she said, "I want to make people know Ebola is real, because when it started, people were in denial about it, they did not believe it existed."
Vital preparations
But it does exist. That is why it is so important for health care workers to be prepared, said Yasmin Kandeh, a training superviser with IOM.
She said it is crucial for workers to know how to properly put on and take off their protective gear. The virus is spread through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, and patients often experience vomiting and diarrhea, so the slightest slipup can turn health workers into patients themselves.
The workers are also taught what behavior to expect from Ebola patients, said Kandeh. "Patients who are delirious and confused, these are some of the major challenges that pop up in the Ebola treatment units, and we just want to prepare the health care workers to be able to manage such challenges efficiently and compassionately."
Diana Garde, a certified nurse and midwife from Seattle, went through the training.
The mock treatment center offered helpful training scenarios, she said. One had needles scattered on the ground. The trainer "would say, ‘You need to be looking at everything when you walk in,'" including the ground, Garde said. That helped because "when things get really busy and things fall on the ground and you’re wearing PPE [personal protective equipment], you can’t see all around you. Your sight is limited."
Inspiring scenes
Garde added that as challenging and busy as her time has been, it will be hard to leave, especially as she has been able to witness people overcome Ebola.
"We have had people we thought were not going to make it and they have walked out on their own two feet, so we have had some incredible success," Garde said. "And sometimes women will come back and visit us and that is always a really good feeling."
The training can also be helpful to Ebola survivors themselves, as many face stigma and are shunned.
Survivor Fonti Kargbo caught Ebola from his wife. She did not survive and neither did his children. Now he is completely alone. He said doing something positive – coming every day to train health care workers – helps keep him going.
"Since I started coming here, at least by interacting, talking about my own story, it makes me forget a little, but it is not easy,” Kargbo stated.
The training with Ebola survivors began last November. Similar training is occurring in Liberia and Guinea, the other countries heavily affected by the disease.

New Ebola Strain Causing West Africa Outbreak
WASHINGTON —
The strain of Ebola virus that has killed 121 people in West Africa may have been circulating there undetected for some time, according to a new study.
This is the first reported outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. But the new study in the New England Journal of Medicine said this strain of the virus may not be new to the area.
Researchers from Africa and Europe compared viral DNA from this outbreak to previous episodes.
They confirmed that it is a member of the Zaire species, which kills most of its victims. Strains of that virus have caused outbreaks previously in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But this virus is a new strain, a previously unknown sister in the Zaire family.
Virologist Jens Kuhn at the National Institutes of Health said there may be more.
“There might be a lot of variety in these viruses. They might be in many different countries in West Africa and East Africa where we have not heard anything of outbreaks so far,” said Kuhn.
Kuhn was not part of this research. He leads the top NIH lab studying the world’s most dangerous viruses, and he is working on ways to treat and prevent infection with them. Kuhn said there is a lesson in this outbreak.
“This is a warning that the variability of these viruses is greater than we knew. And so it’s very important that we develop something that is broadly based and not protects only against a particular virus that we knew of before,” said Kuhn.
Right now, the best protection is to avoid contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person.

Learning About Ebola, Little by Little
Some eight months into the Ebola epidemic, researchers and frontline healthcare workers are starting to confirm some suspicions about how this little-studied pathogen works.
Two new studies shed more light on why some people who become infected get very ill and die, and others are only mildly affected – or not at all.
Recently, officials started using the word “cured” to describe some who have survived the disease.
But we wondered this: experts say we have no cure – or vaccine – for Ebola. So why have these survivors been declared cured?
To answer this and other questions, we talked to two experts: Dr. David Moore, a professor of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. And virologist Christopher Basler, a professor of microbiology at Mount Sanai Hospital in New York City.
VOA: Can someone be cured of Ebola, a disease for which experts say there is no cure?
Moore: “Yes. All survivors who become well again have cleared the infection. This is what is meant by ‘cured.’ It is not the effect of a specific anti-viral treatment, but rather the description of the outcome of the infection.”
Basler: “I think it's clear that the immune system eventually clears the infection. [But if you] mean that some medical intervention that causes the virus to go away, we don't have a specific therapy that targets the virus.”
VOA: Can the Ebola virus lie dormant in someone who has been infected?
Moore: “There is no dormant state.”
Basler: "There's no evidence that the virus will reactivate and cause disease again…no one has ever had a recurrence of illness after a significant period of time. So the assumption is at this point when you can no longer detect the virus in the blood and the person seems healthy that they are past the point where they're going to have disease from that particular infection.”
VOA: Are there different strains of the Ebola virus?
Basler: “Yes. Within the Ebola viruses, there are five so-called 'species.'
“The one that is causing the outbreak now [in West Africa] used to be called Zaire Ebola virus because of where it was first discovered in 1976. Now it's called just Ebola virus. But that tends to be the deadly form of the virus.
“After the Zaire, there's the Sudan virus, the Bundibugyo virus, which is the one that was discovered in Uganda. [There’s] something that's now called Thai Forrest virus and then Reston virus, which is a little bit different. “Reston virus is the one that doesn't seem to cause disease in people as far as we know.”
VOA: Could a person who is no longer testing positive for Ebola become infected with a different strain?
Moore: “The answer is that we don't know. However, the likelihood of two outbreaks due to two different strains occurring at the same time in the same place is vanishingly small.
“We do believe that survivors of infection have some protective immunity after recovery, at least against the strain with which they were infected. This is the basis for the plasma therapy that is going to be trialed. But we do not know for how long such protection might last.”
In September, the World Health Organization opened a training center in Sierra Leone to teach health workers how to treat Ebola patients safely. (photo credit: WHO/N. Alexander)
VOA: This pathogen is considered a very "smart" virus among researchers. Why?
Basler: "The way I think about how the virus causes disease is that there are at least two big components.
“One is that it's very good at block[ing] or defeating a host's immune response. So the immune responses that we have that are basically there to control infections are very effectively suppressed by several of the viral proteins. That suppressing [of the] anti-viral immune response allows the virus to spread throughout the body and grow to very high levels.
“And the other remarkable thing about the virus from my perspective is that it doesn't come from people, it's a zoonotic virus. It probably comes from bats and then occasionally finds its way into the human population.
“In the bat, as far as we know, it doesn't cause any disease. So in some respects you can say the virus is very smart because it can defeat the human immune response. But whatever is involved in bats, it doesn't lead to disease. And so it's an unfortunate accident of what it does to people."
VOA: Is it possible that this virus will become airborne?
David Moore:  “To suggest Ebola could become airborne is unhelpful speculation. There is no precedent for any virus mutating in this way, and nothing in the epidemiology so far that gives even a hint that airborne spread has ever occurred.
“Viruses make errors in their RNA when they replicate. These errors are called mutations and are part and parcel of being a virus. Sometimes they are so important that they weaken the virus so it becomes less able to infect or to replicate. But mutations that make a virus easier to transmit by the airborne route are biologically very difficult to conceive…its not going to happen.”

CDC: Ebola Could Infect 1.4 M by 2015
Between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa could be infected with the Ebola virus by January 20, 2015, according to a report issued on Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The top range of the estimate, 1.4 million, assumes that the number of cases officially cited so far, 5,864 according to the count kept by the World Health Organization, is significantly underreported, and that it is likely that 2.5 times as many cases, or nearly 20,000, have in fact occurred.
CDC emphasized that the projections, based on an epidemiological model that takes into account how many people each Ebola patient eventually infects as well as other factors, is based on data available in August. They therefore do not account for the recently announced U.S. government Ebola relief effort, which includes sending 3,000 members of the armed forces to the Ebola-stricken region.
"Extensive, immediate actions - such as those already started - can bring the epidemic to a tipping point to start a rapid decline in cases," CDC said in a statement.
The agency's best-case model projects that by getting 70 percent of patients into facilities where the risk for transmission is reduced and burying the dead safely, the epidemic would be "almost ended" by January 20.
Liberia in peril
A senior U.N. official warned the escalating Ebola crisis in Liberia is threatening the social fabric of the country, reversing many of the social, economic and political gains achieved since Liberia emerged from civil war.
U.N. special representative Antonio Vigilante said Tuesday the number of Ebola cases in Liberia is doubling every few weeks and stands at more than 3,000. About half of those infected have died.
“While in the last [few] years Liberia was growing at a very interesting rate, the projections for this year have already been slashed by half and perhaps now 70 percent," Vigilante said.
"Production in the mining industry and the agricultural sector and the forestry sector are slowing down, and many in the concessions are actually closed or have had their activities reduced significantly."
Vigilante said poverty is increasing as people lose their livelihoods, markets are short of supplies and people are going hungry because food prices are soaring.
Experimental drug trials
Meanwhile, it was revealed that experimential Ebola drugs will be tested in West Africa for the first time, as part of an initiative to quickly find treatments for the vicious disease.
A London-based charity, the Wellcome Trust, said Tuesday it is giving $5.2 million so a consortium of aid groups, research institutions and the World Health Organization can set up clinical trials at Ebola treatment centers.
There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which has infected more than 5,600 people and killed more than 2,800 in West Africa this year, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The Wellcome Trust says drugmakers taking part in the project include Mapp Biopharmaceutical, whose untested Zmapp drug has been given to a small number of Ebola patients, as well as a Canadian company, Tekmira, and U.S.-based Sarepta.
Precise details of how the trials will be carried out are still under discussion. The Wellcome Trust says participating groups are working with health officials in the affected countries to choose the best sites for the trials.
WHO says the number of people infected with Ebola could grow at an "explosive" rate - exceeding 20,000 by November - unless more is done quickly to control the outbreak.
The New England Journal of Medicine published a report Tuesday by WHO's Ebola Response Team warning that efforts to isolate patients, increase clinical care, safely bury bodies and engage the community must improve quickly to avoid a sharp increase in cases.
WHO Strategy Director Christopher Dye, a co-author of the report, says it is important to act now.
"One of the key messages that we want to get across is that we are now in the third explosive phase of growth of the epidemic," he said. "This is an exponential increase with hundreds, going into thousands of cases per week, and if we don't stop the epidemic very soon, this is going to turn from a disaster into a catastrophe."
The report comes six months after the WHO was first notified of the Ebola outbreak. The virus has infected 5,864 people and killed 2,811.
Tuesday's report says that although Ebola has been reported in many parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, more than 90 percent of the cases have been in just 14 of 67 total districts in those countries.
WHO said Monday that the outbreak appears to have been stopped in Nigeria and Senegal, with no new cases in Nigeria since September 8 and none in Senegal since its first and only case was reported on August 29.
Another 30 to 40 U.S. military personnel are due to arrive in West Africa on Tuesday, joining 60 Americans already there, as part of the U.S. effort to combat Ebola. The United States has committed $175 million to help combat the outbreak and is sending 3,000 troops to the region to build field hospitals and provide logistical aid.
WHO has called for an end to flight cancellations and travel restrictions to the Ebola zone. It says these measures hamper international relief efforts and hurt the countries' economies.

Two Ebola Deaths Confirmed in DRC
Two Ebola deaths have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the country's health minister said Sunday.
According to Felix Kabange Numbi, samples from two of eight people in the country tested positive for the virus.
Also Sunday, a British citizen who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone was being evacuated to Britain. He was to be treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in London.
Two American aid workers infected with Ebola in Liberia and brought back to the U.S. have recovered. They were both released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, last week.
Referring to one of those cases on Friday, the World Health Organization tweeted "Kent Brantly is not the only person who has recovered from Ebola.”
The tweet included a link to a video with three Ebola survivors in Africa.
The World Health Organization reports 1,427 people have died from the Ebola virus during the current outbreak. It also said that as of Friday there were 2,615 confirmed cases in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids of an infected person.
The disease causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea and uncontrollable bleeding through bodily openings, including the eyes, ears and nose.
Previous outbreaks have had a death rate of up to 90 percent, but the death rate in the current epidemic is closer to 50 percent.

WHO: Ebola Spread May Be Slowing in Sierra Leone
GENEVA —
Sierra Leone, the country worst affected by Ebola, reported nearly 250 new confirmed cases in the past week, but the spread of the virus there may be slowing, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.
The epidemic has taken 8,235 lives out of 20,747 known cases worldwide over the past year, it said.
The WHO's weekly report was based on figures reported by authorities in nine countries. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone account for the majority of infections and fatalities.
"There are signs that case incidence may have leveled off in Sierra Leone, although with 248 new confirmed cases reported in the week to 4 January 2015, it remains by far the worst-affected country at present," the WHO said.
Cases are still underreported and unevenly spread in West Africa. The virus is spreading most rapidly in western Sierra Leone, where the capital, Freetown, reported 93 of the new confirmed cases, the WHO said.
"An increasing emphasis will be put on the rapid deployment of smaller treatment facilities to ensure that capacity is matched with demand in each area," the WHO said.
In Guinea, whose capital, Conakry, remains the worst-affected district, the western prefecture of Fria reported its first Ebola cases.
In Liberia, cases dropped from a peak of more than 300 new confirmed cases per week in August and September to eight new confirmed cases and 40 probable cases in the five days to January 2, it said.
Overall, 838 health workers have been infected, and 495 have died, the WHO said.
On Thursday, the WHO will host a meeting of representatives from major drugmakers, health authorities in affected countries and national regulatory agencies to assess clinical trials of experimental vaccines against Ebola. GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and NewLink Genetics, and Johnson & Johnson are currently testing experimental vaccines.

Hope Sparks in Liberia as US Soldiers Arrive to Help Fight Ebola
MONROVIA, LIBERIA —
It is lunchtime in Monrovia and the smell of chlorine is everywhere.
Jacey Toe sits on her wooden cart under an umbrella while eating yellow saffron rice with fresh fish from the nearby ocean. The young street vendor, and mother of two, sells toothpaste, tissue and soap. The Ministry of Finance is just up the street.
Toe said business is not going well these days. She makes about $18 a month. Before the Ebola crisis, her income was almost four times more.
"Well, life in Monrovia is very difficult. The street people are not fine. Business [is] not running. Most of the government ministries are closed. [There are] no jobs,” she said.
Another problem is that schools are closed and her children have to stay at home and have nothing to do.
Six months into the world’s worst Ebola outbreak, Monrovians like Toe say the situation remains tense.
But there is a growing sense of optimism the epidemic can be contained in Liberia, where citizens said they welcomed the help of the United States as the first of 3,000 soldiers arrived in the country to assist with medical logistics.
“We pray that the American troops come and be able to help our Liberian sisters and brothers. Because it is killing a lot of people," Toe said.
Many share her optimism.
Among other things, the United States has committed $175 million and will build 17 new health care facilities in the region with 100 beds each and train up to 500 health care providers per week.
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf called America’s help “a significant moment in the battle against Ebola." She has promised she will not rest until Ebola is defeated.
More than 100 U.S. military personnel should be in West Africa by the end of the week with more to follow.
But 49-year-old community worker Matthew Sandiki said America’s help is only a starting point.
“We also call on other nations, Germany, to join America, to help us fight Ebola because we cannot do it alone. Our health [care] system has broken down completely.”
After U.S. President Barack Obama announced the U.S. troop deployment, the U.N.Security Council issued a call for all nations to provide assistance, calling Ebola a threat to international security.
At SKD sports complex, named after Liberia’s former president Samuel Doe, the United Nations is building a new transit hub to receive the loads of cargo that Liberia needs to contain the crisis.
Construction supervisor Kennet Blixt said the site was chosen because of its location.
“It is very convenient, close to the airport and pretty much on the main roads going up country and avoiding the city. Currently, most of the city’s storage capacities are at the port. So, to take it there from the airport, you have to go through the entire city,” he said.
West Africa has been battling with other nations’ travel restrictions, something the World Health Organization says is unnecessary and will hamper international relief efforts.
Ebola has infected more than 5,600 people and killed more than 2,800 this year, mostly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
The World Health Organization said the number of people infected with Ebola could grow at an "explosive" rate, exceeding 20,000 by November, unless more is done quickly to control the outbreak.

Sierra Leone Ends Ebola Lockdown
Sierra Leone has ended a three-day nationwide lockdown aimed at stopping the Ebola outbreak.
The health ministry on Sunday said it had reached 75 percent of its target of visiting 1.5 million homes.
The government had ordered Sierra Leone's six million people to stay home Friday, Saturday and Sunday so teams could go door-to-door, trying to locate hidden Ebola patients and educate others on how to avoid the deadly disease.
Officials said the outreach would continue in communities that have been identified as hot spots across the country.
The operation appears to have gone smoothly, except for an incident Saturday when young people attacked workers trying to bury bodies of Ebola victims near the capital, Freetown. The attackers dispersed after reinforcements arrived to protect the burial team.
Operation 'successful'
The head of Sierra Leone's Emergency Operations Center, Stephen Gaojia, said he was pleased with the outcome of the initiative, saying that many people had come forward to get relatives tested and treated.
“The three-day house to house Ebola talk has overall been successful,” said Ngaojia. “The exercise has been able to fast track the response effort ... We have been able to get a lot of people coming forward to actually get their people in different isolation centers and treatment centers.”
Ngaojia hailed the cooperation of citizens in the government’s move to reduce the infection rate, after rejecting media reports that some of the emergency workers were attacked.
“This exercise has actually created an outreach wherein there has been massive awareness in the minds of the majority of Sierra Leoneans,” said Ngaojia. “[They] were very respectful to the teams that went to their homes ... Now, at the family level some discussions have been generated, and at the community level that Ebola is real and is in our communities.”
Ngaojia says members of his team are still gathering information about the performance of the volunteers who went house to house to educate and administer test to people for the disease.
Ebola in numbers
Sierra Leone’s information minister told VOA that current figures show there are 1,400 cases of Ebola in the country. He said the government in Freetown aims to reduce the infection rate.
Ngaojia said the three-day containment measure aims to help efforts to combat the disease.
“This exercise was not to say that it will completely break the chain of transmission in any way by any means. What we have done is to think outside the box,” he said
“If we have been able to get very close to 200 people in different areas who came forward to be tested and maybe 50 percent tested positive in a way that is a huge success story. It is another effort in being actually able to identify some of the people who have been infected ... bring them to holding centers, get them tested and take them to treatment centers within the shortest possible time,” Ngaojia said.
In total, Ebola has infected more than 5,300 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea this year, and killed more than 2,600.
The United States has committed $175 million to help combat the outbreak, and is sending 3,000 troops to the region to build field hospitals and provide logistical aid.

Information That Can Save Lives
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Throughout its history, VOA has always delivered the news. For months now, in its coverage of the Ebola crisis, VOA has been delivering news that saves lives.
Prominently displayed on the first page of VOA’s website, for example, is a special section devoted to the Ebola outbreak. It features public service announcements providing basic facts about the disease from President Obama, the first lady of Sierra Leone, Sia Nyama Koroma, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
President Obama, in his announcement, specifically addressed the people of West Africa, where Ebola has struck the hardest. The president explained how the disease is transmitted and the precautions to be taken in caring for loved ones who have it or those who have died from it. “When burying someone who has died from this terrible disease,” the president said, “it’s important to not directly touch their body. You can respect your traditions and honor your loved ones without risking the lives of the living.”
​In their video comments, the first lady of Sierra Leone and Dr. Fauci stressed the advantages of early detection and urged people not to stigmatize those who have the disease. These public service announcements are being widely disseminated on VOA’s English-language programming to Africa, as well as on all the VOA language services that broadcast to Africa. Also being widely distributed are guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Médecins Sans Frontières about the disease.
VOA’s language services to Africa have also produced their own public service announcements about the disease, voiced by artists, singers, poets and others well known in the target region. Ali Nuhu, one of the most prominent names in Nigeria’s film industry, did an announcement for VOA’s Hausa Service that explained how to recognize Ebola symptoms and where to go for help.
​To ensure that people know all they need to know, VOA has also set up an Ebola microsite that provides clear answers to the most-asked questions: What is Ebola? How to avoid getting Ebola? What are the symptoms of Ebola? How is Ebola treated? Another section of the microsite stresses the danger of misinformation, such as the false report of a vaccine for the disease. To reach as many people as possible, the site is designed to work well on mobile phones, including the so-called “feature phone” that is popular in West Africa. And there is no doubt VOA’s Ebola websites are reaching people. So far they have had over 1.5 million visits.

VOA correspondents have also ramped up their coverage from West Africa, with reports from Liberia, Guinea, and other countries where the disease has struck. A special VOA team is in place in Lagos to report on Nigeria’s efforts to contain Ebola. Another team is heading to Atlanta to learn how the Centers for Disease Control is working to find treatments and develop a vaccine.
While VOA works overtime to get the facts about Ebola to affected areas, thousands of U.S. troops and medical personnel prepare to travel to the affected areas and VOA plans extensive coverage of that American humanitarian effort.
“VOA has long been a trusted source of news,” says VOA Director David Ensor, “and in times of crisis, as in Africa now, trust is vitally important. It can save lives.”

Cameroon ‘Redoubles’ Efforts to Combat Boko Haram
Cameroon is redoubling efforts to end violence carried out on its territory by the Nigeria-based Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The move comes after militants reportedly forced Nigerian troops to cross the border into the Central African nation, according to information minister Issa Tchiroma.
Tchiroma said military collaboration between the two neighboring countries remains strong despite Cameroon’s decision to close all of its borders with Nigeria due to the ongoing Ebola outbreak.
“Whenever we have information regarding this [Boko Haram] problem, we share information,” said Tchiroma. "Cameroon soldiers have instructions to defend our borders. So they will fight for as long as they are assaulted by Boko Haram to protect our borders.”
About 700 Nigerian troops reportedly crossed into Cameroon following heavy clashes with Boko Haram militants.
“Indeed they crossed the border and they wanted us to give them the support they need," said Tchiroma. "We welcomed them given the fact that we are in close relation with Nigeria, and we facilitated their temporary stay in our country, and they were taken back to their own nation.”
Tchiroma says the government in Yaoundé helped the Nigerian soldiers to safely return home.
He said Cameroon closed its border with Nigeria in a bid to protect citizens from Ebola and dismissed suggestions that the military cooperation between the two countries could be derailed due to the closing.
“We have decided not to spare any effort in order to contain the aggression and to push [Boko Haram] back to keep them out of our nation,” said Tchiroma.
He said the country is grateful for the pledge of international support to help Cameroon combat the security threat posed by Boko Haram militants.
“Many other nations have promised to give us the assistance including The United States, European Union, France, China, [and] United Kingdom, have promised to give us the necessary support in terms of information, and any kind of necessary collaboration,” Tchiroma said.

Nigeria President Unhappy with Ebola Stigmatization
Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan Wednesday condemned the stigmatization of Nigerians travelling abroad, due to the recent outbreak of Ebola in the country.
In a meeting with David Nabarro, Special Envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, Jonathan said there was no justification for such stigmatization, since his administration has made significant efforts to contain the disease. He specifically expressed concern about actions at the Youth Olympics in China.
“President Jonathan pointed out that it is unfortunate that there have been attempts by some countries to stigmatize Nigerians when they travel abroad,” said presidentials spokesman Reuben Abati. “When our youth team went for sporting competition in China, they were prevented from taking part in that event and they had to return home and the Nigerian government felt very bad about it and President Jonathan drew attention to what happened in China.”
Four countries in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria are battling the Ebola disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the total number of probable and confirmed cases in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease is 3,069, with 1,552 deaths. The WHO also said the disease could affect about 20,000 people before the crisis is over.
Abati said the government has been successful in preventing the Ebola outbreak from becoming an epidemic.
“The commendation by the United Nations, clearly shows that Nigeria has done very well in controlling and containing the spread of the virus after the index case that occurred here,” said Abati.
Local media quoted Nabarro as praising Nigeria’s effort to contain the outbreak.
“The secretary-general asked me to come here too, not because you have an Ebola problem, but because you have tackled it in an exemplary fashion… Your personal leadership on the matter has been key," he said. "There may still be some work to be done before the virus is completely cleared out from here, but other countries can learn from your fine example.”
Abati said Jonathan assured the special U.N. envoy that his administration will continue with efforts to eradicate Ebola.
He said the government in Abuja will soon contact countries that are alleged to have attempted to stigmatize citizens to resolve any concerns.
“I believe that the statement by President Jonathan would be the first step in drawing international attention to the attempts by some countries to stigmatize citizens of other countries,” said Abati.
“We do not expect that, with the level of information that is available on the Nigerian situation, other countries would go out of their way to stigmatize Nigerians. Because effectively in Nigeria, the government has been able to control and contain the spread of the virus,” he said.

WHO: Polio Resurfaces in Mali from Ebola-hit Guinea
GENEVA —
There is a high risk of polio spreading in Ebola-ravaged Guinea and Mali, the World Health Organization said on Monday, after a Guinean toddler travelled to Mali and became that country's first case of the crippling disease in more than four years.
Preliminary tests by authorities in Mali's capital showed the 19-month-old was paralyzed on July 20, seven days before being brought to Bamako for treatment. The strain of the virus is the same as one detected in Siguiri in Guinea's Kankan region, in August 2014.
The Mali polio case, caused by a strain of the virus known as type 2, is the second setback in a week for global efforts to eradicate polio, after two cases were reported in Ukraine.
"The risk of spread is considered to be high in both countries due to low rates of vaccination coverage in both Mali and Guinea," WHO spokesman Cory Couillard said in an emailed comment to Reuters.
"Both countries are taking coordinated emergency response measures to bring the outbreak to an end quickly."
The Mali and Ukraine cases are both vaccine-derived polio, meaning the virus spread after being excreted by people who have been immunized with live oral polio vaccine.
Vaccine-derived polio outbreaks are rare but pose a greater risk in populations where health systems are fragile and people immunization coverage is low.
WHO figures show Guinea's polio vaccination coverage fell from 63 percent to 42 percent in 2014, as the Ebola outbreak caused chaos and overwhelmed an already weak national health system. In Mali, by contrast, polio vaccination coverage rose to 84 percent in 2014, from 72-77 percent in preceding years.
There is no cure for polio, which attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours of infection.
It mainly affects young children in areas with poor sanitation.
A global vaccination campaign has largely stamped out the virus, and only Pakistan and Afghanistan have reported cases of wild polio virus this year. Like Ukraine, Madagascar and Nigeria have suffered vaccine-derived cases.

Nigeria Health Minister Expresses Confidence in Ebola Containment Measures
ABUJA, NIGERIA —
Nigeria’s health minister says the administration has made strides in containing the Ebola disease by implementing a “multidimensional and Multi-sectorial” approach to combat the disease after some infected patients were successfully treated and discharged.
There have been 12 confirmed Ebola cases in Nigeria with at least four deaths.
Onyebuchi Chukwu said the government will not relent on its effort to eradicate the Ebola disease in spite of the successes of containing the virus which so far has left an estimated 1,069 people dead in four West African countries.
Increased screening
He said the government is stepping up efforts to secure the country’s borders by screening travelers who visit Nigeria at the point of entry.
"We need to secure our airports we need to secure our land borders we need to secure our seaports so that is one strategy. Right now in Lagos, we are following up on 121 secondary contacts, but none of them is symptomatic said,” said Chukwu. “So the fact that all of our cases have been primary contacts of index case shows that our containment plan is working.”
Chukwu said the government’s efforts to contain the Ebola disease should give confidence to citizens about the bid to eradicate any further infections.
“One non-Nigerian and 11 Nigerians have been diagnosed, but out of the 12, unfortunately, we have lost four, and so we have lost four including the index case. Now of the 8 that are surviving, we have actually successfully discharged five of them. We have only three that are on admission, and we have every hope they will recover. So that should give everyone confidence that we are doing the right thing,” he said.
Global collaboration
Chukwu said the health ministry is working with both local and international partners to contain the disease. Chukwu hailed contributions from the United States to help combat the disease, following a recent meeting with ambassador James F. Entwistle, who he said promised more assistance to help with efforts to contain the Ebola disease.
“We are working with our partners; principally the World Health Organization. They are involved in every aspect of the containment strategy along with our own people,” said Chukwu. “The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been so wonderful in fact the U.S. government has been so supportive even I had a meeting with the American ambassador to Nigeria and he was promising more assistance.”
Some Nigerians have expressed concern about the disease, speculating that infections have increased in some parts of the country. Chukwu said that is not the case and those rumors are unsubstantiated.
He said Nigeria is cooperating with neighboring countries battling the Ebola virus including, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
“Certainly, we will offer technical assistance,” said Chukwu. “Minister of health in West Africa will meet in Accra next week and we are going to reemphasize that we are willing to be of help to the other countries. So, surely we will offer our assistance.”

Oxfam: Ebola Could be 'Disaster of Our Generation'
The international aid agency Oxfam is appealing to European Union foreign ministers to do more to fight Ebola; a disease Oxfam said could be the "definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation."
The chief of the British charity, Mark Goldring, called for more troops, funding and medical staff to be sent to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - the countries hit hardest by the epidemic.
Goldring said countries that fail to make a commitment to fight Ebola "are in danger of costing lives."
Echoing that comment, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said, in an open letter to the BBC Sunday, that the fight against Ebola is one in which "the whole world has a stake."
Sirleaf said, "It is the duty of all, as global citizens, to send a message that they will not leave millions of West Africans to fend for themselves."
She added that the disease was unleashing an economic catastrophe that will leave a “lost generation” of young West Africans.
US quick-reaction team
Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesman said U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the creation of a 30-member expeditionary medical support team to be able to provide emergency help in the event of an Ebola crisis in the United States.
The plan would be for a team of five doctors, 20 nurses and five trainers to be able to respond on short notice to help civilian medical professionals, a statement from Rear Admiral John Kirby said.
Three cases of Ebola have been diagnosed in the United States, prompting widespread concern about the potential spread of the virus. A Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, fell ill while on a trip to Dallas, Texas, and died on Oct. 8.
Two nurses who treated him have contracted the disease. One nurse is being cared for in Maryland and the other is being treated in Atlanta, Georgia.
Kirby called the team “an added, prudent measure to ensure our nation is ready to respond quickly, effectively and safely in the event of additional Ebola cases. ... They will not be sent to West Africa or elsewhere overseas and will be called upon domestically only if deemed prudent by our public health professionals,” the statement said.
U.S. President Barack Obama met with members of his national security and public health teams Saturday evening to discuss the response to the domestic Ebola cases.
21-day monitoring
Some of the dozens of people who are being watched for possible exposure to Ebola in the United States are expected to be cleared on Sunday and Monday, potentially easing concerns about the spread of the disease after two nurses were infected.
At midnight, nearly 50 people who might have been in contact with Duncan will no longer require monitoring for signs of the virus, health officials said Sunday.
On Monday, more were expected to end 21 days of monitoring - the incubation period for the virus.
They would include Duncan's fiancee, Louise Troh, her 13-year-old son and two other people who have been in mandatory quarantine at an undisclosed location in Dallas.
Also, a Dallas lab worker who spent much of a Caribbean holiday cruise in isolation tested negative for the deadly virus and left the Carnival Magic liner with other passengers after it docked at Galveston, Texas, early Sunday.
However, there are still 75 health workers in Dallas who have isolated themselves and are being monitored.
In his weekly Saturday address, Obama called on Americans not to give in to Ebola "hysteria or fear."
The president urged people to keep the situation in perspective. He said the U.S. may see more isolated cases, but said he is "absolutely confident" officials can prevent a serious outbreak.
Texas hospital apologizes
In a public letter on Saturday night, Texas Health Resources Chief Executive Barclay Berdan acknowledged that Texas Health Presbyterian, where Duncan first went, made mistakes, including initially not diagnosing Ebola.
Berdan said aggressive actions since then ensured that the hospital was a safe place, and that outside experts would be consulted to determine how the two nurses became infected.
Canada says it will send 800 vials of an experimental Ebola vaccine to the World Health Organization in Geneva starting Monday - and the U.N. World Food Program airdropped emergency rations to more than 260,000 people in the Waterloo district of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
The area has seen an usually high number of cases of Ebola. Many families have been quarantined.​
The worst outbreak on record of the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids of sick people, has killed more than 4,500 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
​Cuba would aid US in Ebola fight
Meanwhile, Fidel Castro, the former leader of Cuba, said the Caribbean island nation will "gladly cooperate" with the U.S. in the fight against Ebola in West Africa.
Writing in the state media Saturday, the 88-year-old Castro said the cooperation would be in the interest of "peace in the world," and is not an attempt to resolve issues between the U.S. and Cuba.
"We will gladly cooperate with American personnel in that task and not in search for peace between the two states that have been adversaries for so many years, but in any case, for peace in the world, a goal that can and should be attempted," a Cuban television broadcaster read Castro's remarks on the air.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry praised Cuba's efforts Friday for its impressive response to the Ebola crisis, saying "Cuba - a country of just 11 million people - has sent 165 health professionals and it plans to send nearly 300 more" to hard-hit West Africa.
Cuba has a history of sending its doctors to emergencies around the world.
"It took our country not one minute to respond to the international agencies before requesting support against the brutal epidemic that has broken out in West Africa. It's what our country has always done without excluding anyone," Castro said in his remarks.
Jorge Perez, director of the tropical disease hospital where Cuban doctors train for the Ebola mission, said he believed the U.S. and Cuban missions to fight Ebola could lead to improved diplomatic relations.
Cuba has sent medical brigades to disaster sites around the world since the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power.
Besides medical diplomacy, Cuba sends doctors overseas in exchange for money or goods, notably Venezuelan oil, making professional services a top export earner.

Journalist With Ebola Being Evaluated at US Hospital
An American journalist diagnosed in Liberia with the Ebola virus has returned to the United States for treatment.
Ashoka Mukpo is in an isolation unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, where a spokesman said his condition is being evaluated to determine the course of his treatment.
At a news conference Monday a hospital official said Mukpo walked off an airplane under his own power and was wheeled into the hospital on a gurney.
Another hospital official said the patient is suffering from fever and nausea and his symptoms have not changed significantly in the past 24 hours.
Mukpo is receiving treatment at the Nebraska Medical Center’s specialized isolation unit, the largest of four such facilities in the United States.
The freelance photojournalist is the fifth American diagnosed with the Ebola virus.
A Spanish nurse who helped treat an Ebola patient at a Madrid hospital has contracted the virus, becoming the first person to become infected outside West Africa.
Spanish health officials Monday said the nurse was part of the medical team that treated a 69-year-old Spanish priest who died in a hospital last month after being flown back from Sierra Leone.
Despite the news from Spain and the hospitalization of a fifth American to contract the disease, U.S. President Barack Obama Monday said the chances for an Ebola outbreak in the United States are "extremely low."
Obama said his administration is working on additional protocols for screening airplane passengers to identify people who might have the deadly virus. He also said he will step up pressure on large countries, which he did not identify by name, to contribute aid to West African nations struggling to contain the worst outbreak of Ebola on record.
On assignment in Liberia
Mukpo was on assignment in Liberia for NBC News when he tested positive for Ebola last week and was sent back to the United States on a specially equipped plane.
Another American who contracted Ebola in Liberia, Dr. Rick Sacra, was the first patient with Ebola treated and released at the Nebraska facility last month.
Sacra was treated successfully for Ebola in Nebraska and discharged on September 25. However, he was rehospitalized over the weekend in Worcester, Massachusetts, after being admitted on Saturday for what appeared to be a respiratory infection.
He was released on Monday after being treated for the respiratory infection.
In critical condition
Liberian national Thomas Duncan, the first reported Ebola patient in the U.S., remained in critical condition on Monday at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. He has been hospitalized since September 28.
Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said health officials were closely monitoring 10 people who had direct contact with Duncan and are considered at greatest risk.
Frieden said so far none has shown any symptoms.
Texas Governor Rick Perry said at a news conference on Monday that he is establishing a team of physicians and health care experts to deal with infectious diseases.
The head of the Texas team, Dr. Brett Giroir, said, “We live in an interconnected world, where an outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere."
Ebola has taken about 3,500 lives in West Africa since the outbreak began last year. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are the hardest-hit countries.

Ebola-Hit Nations Aim for No New Cases in 60 Days
The three West African countries hardest hit by Ebola have set a target of reducing new cases to zero within 60 days.
Guinea's presidency said in a statement Monday that the presidents of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia made the pledge after closed-door talks in Conakry.
The Ebola virus has killed more than 9,000 people in those three countries. Its spread is slowing, but the World Health Organization warned of complacency after a recent uptick in cases.
In its latest update Monday, the WHO reported 183 new cases in the region — 87 in Sierra Leone, 76 in Liberia and 20 in Guinea.
In another development, thousands of Liberian children returned to school on Monday after a six-month school closure during the height of the Ebola epidemic.
Students washed their hands and had their temperatures taken before entering schools. Some schools still remain closed.
Rosemary Grey, a school principal in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, said it is important to reopen the schools even if there is still a danger from Ebola.
"If we wait for the day that Ebola will be eradicated before we can reopen schools, I don't think that we are ever going to open schools, because even now I heard there is a new outbreak," she said. "Nobody knows how far it's going to go. And if schools are going to close perpetually, students are going to remain at home.''
The Ebola virus is transmitted through contact with the body fluids of an infected person. Health officials have warned people to avoid all direct contact with Ebola patients, including those killed by the disease, who remain contagious.

CDC Chief: US Ebola Patient 'Fighting for His Life'
DALLAS —
A top U.S. public health official says the Liberian Ebola patient in the southwestern state of Texas is "fighting for his life" at a Dallas hospital.
Dr. Thomas Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) told CNN's State of the Union program Sunday that finding everyone who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan will help stop Ebola in its tracks.
He said that is why he is confident there will not be an outbreak in the United States. But he said U.S. authorities are deeply concerned about what is happening in West Africa, where he says the longer the epidemic lasts, the more it might spread to other countries.
Duncan's condition worsened Saturday from serious to critical. He was diagnosed with Ebola four days after arriving in the United States September 20 from Liberia.
Frieden said hospitals nationwide have become more vigilant in checking incoming patients for potential risks, particularly among those traveling recently from West Africa.
The CDC has narrowed the number of individuals in Dallas at greatest risk of infection from Duncan, identifying nine people who had direct contact with him.
Another 40 were being monitored as potential contacts, out of a group of 114 people initially evaluated for exposure risks, though none from either group has shown symptoms, Frieden said.
One of the Americans infected while working in the region, Dr. Richard Sacra, was in isolation in Worcester, Massachusetts, after being admitted Saturday for what appeared to be a respiratory infection.
Sacra was treated successfully for Ebola in Nebraska and discharged on September 25. He was stable and being watched for signs of a relapse of the disease at University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center, the Boston Globe.
Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva.
A hospital patient in Sarasota, Florida, was being monitored and treated for possible symptoms in isolation as a precaution because he, too, had traveled recently to West Africa, Governor Rick Scott said on Saturday.
But a patient admitted under similar circumstances to Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., after a recent trip to Nigeria was ruled out as an Ebola victim earlier in the day.
Ebola has killed about 3,500 people in West Africa since the outbreak began last year. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are the hardest-hit countries.

Liberia Lifts Ebola Curfew, Opens Borders
A Liberian health ministry official said the country will continue to observe all Ebola preventive protocols and regulations until it achieves “zero infections.”
This came as President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Sunday ordered the lifting of the nationwide Ebola curfew put in place in August to prevent the further spread of the virus.
Sirleaf also ordered the opening of the country’s borders with its West African neighbors.
Tolbert Nyenswah, the assistant minister of health for preventive services and head of the country’s Ebola response, said Liberia is returning to a more normal state in light of the recent decline in the number of Ebola cases and the reopening of schools.
“We are seeing some light after the massive Ebola crisis here. Things are improving. And so, the economy of the country has to restart, the president has lifted the curfew, and kids have to go back to school. And so, these are all activities that indicate [we’re] moving toward normality,” he said.
Nyenswah said that if Liberia is reporting even a single case of Ebola per day, that means the disease is still in the country.
But, he added that unlike in the past, there has been a significant improvement in the response to new cases.
“Every single case that is reported in Liberia now is on the contact list. In the past 21 days, we’ve seen only 14 Ebola cases as compared to 70 to 100 cases in the month of August. Our team is robust in the response together with our international partners, including the US government. So, we are optimistic we will get to zero [cases] soon,” Nyenswah said.
Sirleaf also ordered the opening of Liberia’s borders, even as neighboring countries like Sierra Leone continue to report moderate to high infections.
Nyenswah said Liberia has instituted robust cross-border surveillance.
“Our county health teams in Liberia are more vigilant with cross-border surveillance. All of our border counties have been freed of Ebola either in the last 35 to 42 days, including Grand Cape Mounty, Gbarpolu, Lofa, and Nimba. These counties bordering Sierra Leone and Guinea have been Ebola free over 42 days now,” Nyenswah said.
Liberian schools reopened February 16 after they had been shut down since last year. Nyenswah said the government has been distributing Ebola prevention materials to thousands of schools across the country.
“We delivered Ebola prevention materials to 4,000-plus schools in Liberia covering about one-million school-going children. These materials include temperature check devices, chlorine, and hand-washing equipment like buckets. We continue to carry on assessment to make sure that the rest of the schools in Liberia get those materials,” Nyenswah said.

In Sierra Leone, Ebola Fades But Still Impacts Mental Health
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE —
The last known Ebola patient in Sierra Leone was released from a hospital Monday. If the country goes 42 days without a new case, it will be declared Ebola-free. But the virus’ effects continue to haunt many residents, including those who buried the bodies of Ebola victims.
When Ebola was at its peak a year ago, corpses sometimes would be left for days before being picked up by overwhelmed burial teams.
The images of decomposed bodies began to haunt burial worker Abu Bakar Kalokah after he joined the Red Cross.
"You become nervous. Sometimes you sit alone, thinking what is going to happen tomorrow because tomorrow is another day and the work is not easy," he said.
All burials in Sierra Leone must be done by teams wearing protective gear to prevent the virus from spreading from the deceased to the living.
Seeing people killed by Ebola day in and day out was daunting for the burial teams. Some even turned to drugs and alcohol to cope.
Relief valve
To ease their burden, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) brought in brought in psychosocial experts to administer psychological first aid.
One method they taught burial members to do, was to use comedic skits, song and dance to ease stress.
Performing for each other helps everyone decompress, said another burial team member, Tamba Musa, adding, "When they come and see these funny dances, it makes them forget the day’s traumas, the trauma they’ve gone through."
Joshua Abioseh Duncan is a coordinator for the Mental Health Coalition of Sierra Leone. The coalition, created in 2011, strives to make sure that mental health professionals are available in every district of the country.
Psychosocial support
This includes teaching people how to provide psychosocial support for each other.
For the Ebola response the coalition also worked with government and international partners on mental health issues. This included teaching people how to provide psychosocial support for each other in communities.
Counseling will need to continue after the country is Ebola-free, Duncan said. But, he worries there may not be enough trained people to help.
"I only know of one Sierra Leone psychologist, and for me that is a challenge," Duncan said. "Professional counselors – we need more of them. We need more individuals to provide service with regards to issues of this kind."
He added that there’s only one psychiatrist for the country’s 6 million people. With so many affected by Ebola, he said, it’s simply not enough.

WHO Pushes for Rapid, Safe Ebola Diagnostic Tests
GENEVA —
The World Health Organization reports it is launching two initiatives to stimulate the development of better and faster Ebola diagnostic tests for use in heavily disease-infected West African countries.
Sensitive Ebola diagnostic tests are urgently needed to stem the transmission of this fatal disease in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the U.N. agency said. It said said cumbersome, slow and complex tests have hampered efforts to contain the outbreak.
More than 12 WHO mobile laboratories have been deployed in West Africa. They use a test that provides accurate results when performed by trained staff, which is not always available. Each test requires a full tube of blood, takes from two to six hours, and costs around $100.
Those requirements are challenging in West Africa, severely limiting testing ability, said Pierre Formenty, who leads the organization’s emerging and epidemic zoonotic diseases team.
When the number of Ebola cases in West Africa begins to decrease, he said great effort will be needed to chase down the last Ebola case to declare the epidemic over.
"So, we will need in four to six months from now to increase the number of laboratory tests to be sure that we are not missing cases," Formenty said. "To do that increase, we need to change our strategy in terms of the laboratory. We need to augment the number of tests. ... We will really need to find the very last cases of Ebola."
Reducing obstacles
Formenty said the WHO is minimizing the barriers faced by diagnostic companies to develop and deploy their tests. He says the U.N. agency will collaborate with manufacturers, academic researchers and staff from Doctors Without Borders, among others, to move the process forward.
In four months, two types of tests will be in the pipeline, he predicted. One is a rapid test and the other is an automatic version of the current test.
Laboratory technicians will need to diagnose between 1,000 and 10,000 cases per day, he said. "So, you need a lot of these kits and today it is not possible to do that” in the mobile labs, even with considerable expertise.
"We really need easy-to-use diagnostic tests and we will need, of course, to build the lab that we are talking about for each district, but also to train the people to do these tests," Formenty said.
WHO officials said the new rapid diagnostic test should produce results in 15 to 30 minutes, cost just a few dollars and have no bio-safety requirements beyond wearing personal protective equipment.

IMF Prepares New Aid in Ebola’s Wake
MONROVIA —
The International Monetary Fund is preparing around $150 million in additional support to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic, the fund's representative in Liberia told Reuters on Thursday.
"In Guinea and Sierra Leone, existing fund financial programs are being augmented to provide more resources to these countries. In Liberia, a one-off disbursement under the fund's Rapid Credit Facility is being considered," Charles Amo-Yartey told Reuters in an email.
The money could be made available in the first quarter of this year and would add to $130 million disbursed by the fund in September.
The three West African states’ economies have been damaged by the Ebola outbreak, which had killed at least 8,235 people since starting more than a year ago, the Word Health Organization reported Wednesday.
Liberia and Sierra Leone also are recovering from civil wars.
Sierra Leone, the country worst hit, reported nearly 250 new confirmed cases in the past week, but the spread of the virus there may be slowing. The rate of transmission has ebbed in Liberia and Guinea.
The aid follows a decision by Group of 20 leaders in Australia in November to support countries hit by Ebola through reform of the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust, said an IMF spokeswoman in Washington.
The trust was set up after the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010 to enable the IMF to join debt relief efforts for very poor countries hit by natural disasters.
IMF staff members are developing a proposal for at least $130 million in interest-free financial support for the three countries, the spokeswoman said. The proposal is expected to be presented to the fund's executive board later this month.

US Health Official: Widespread Ebola Outbreak Unlikely
WASHINGTON —
America’s top disease prevention official says he remains confident the United States will not experience a significant outbreak of Ebola, but that containment in Africa is critical to reducing risks elsewhere in the world.
At present, a Liberian man in Dallas, Texas, is the only confirmed active Ebola case known in the United States. But swift responses to recent false alarms show a national medical community on high alert, including the mobilization of a disease control unit to meet an incoming international flight on which an African man had become ill - as it turns out, with something other than Ebola.
The Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tom Frieden, says there is no cause for panic.
“Here in the U.S., I remain quite confident we will not have a widespread outbreak. We will stop it in its tracks. We have got infection control [units] in hospitals and public health that tracks and isolates people if they get symptoms,” said Frieden, speaking on ABC’s This Week program.
He emphasized that, ultimately, Ebola must be controlled at its source.
“I am quite concerned, the longer this goes on in these three West African countries, the greater the possibility that other countries in Africa are going to have to fight this on their territory, as well. We have to recognize that, try as we might, until the outbreak is controlled in Africa, we cannot get the risk here to zero,” said Frieden.
The United States has dispatched military and civilian personnel to West Africa to help combat the virus, which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in recent months. Meanwhile, some African immigrants in the United States say they fear being shunned if the public’s apprehensions about Ebola escalate to widespread panic.
“Just being a black person or just being a citizen from Africa does not mean you have Ebola,” said Steve Oriabure, a Nigerian immigrant in Dallas.
Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person or corpse. Symptoms appear two to 21 days after infection.

West Africa Ebola Toll Rises to 467
West African health officials will meet in Ghana this week to discuss ways of controlling the Ebola outbreak that has claimed more than 450 lives.
The World Health Organization says ministers of health and directors of disease prevention from 11 countries will hold a two-day meeting beginning Wednesday in Accra.
The WHO says new cases of Ebola continue to be reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It says the death toll from confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the virus stands at 467, the majority of them in Guinea.
The U.N. agency said the virus is being transmitted mainly in rural communities, cross-border areas and densely populated parts of the Guinean and Liberian capitals.
Authorities have warned people to avoid direct contact with those infected by the virus, whether alive or dead. The WHO said "traditional beliefs" and continued commercial and social activities are contributing to continued transmission of the virus.
The outbreak, the first of its kind in West Africa, began early this year in southeastern Guinea.

UN Seeks $660 Million to Target Ebola Transmission
UNITED NATIONS —
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday that the world deliberative body is establishing an Ebola crisis center with the goal of stopping transmission of the virus in affected countries within six to nine months.
Ban said the U.N. is mobilizing in every way to stop the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 2,000 people (2,097) in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria with its hemorrhagic fever-like symptoms.
He said the U.N. is sending out an international “rescue call,” asking for $600 million for supplies needed in West Africa.
“The number of cases is rising exponentially," he said. "The disease is spreading far faster than the response. People are increasingly frustrated that it is not being controlled.”
Ban spoke to reporters briefly after meeting with the World Health Organization chief, Dr. Margaret Chan, Dr. David Nabarro of the United Nations and other senior U.N. officials.
The secretary-general said the next few weeks would be crucial in getting more supplies and medical personnel to the affected countries. He urged airlines and shipping companies not to cancel flights, saying that will not halt the spread of the disease, but would keep medical teams from reaching the people most in need.
“It is crucial to remember that Ebola can be avoided and controlled," he said. "The virus has been contained elsewhere in the past, and we can do it today as well. We know what to do and what needs to be done.”
WHO says the risk of Ebola transmission is low. Becoming infected requires direct, physical contact with blood or other body fluids from a person who has the virus, or from a victim's body. There have been nearly 4,000 confirmed cases of Ebola cases in the four West African countries.
Although Ebola is a “huge, serious challenge,” Ban said, he is convinced of success, provided there is enough assistance from the international community.

Ebola Devastates W. Africa, Horrifies World in 2014
In 2014, the Ebola virus erupted in West Africa. The epidemic remains a humanitarian crisis of epic proportion. More than 20,000 people likely have been infected by the virus, which so far has killed at least 7,842, the World Health Organization reports.
The epidemic began quietly in rural southeastern Guinea in the last days of 2013. The Ebola virus then raged through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It made forays into Nigeria and Mali, killing more than a third of those it infected, including doctors and caregivers. In its wake, Ebola left behind thousands of orphans.
This has been the biggest and most challenging Ebola outbreak since the virus was identified in 1976, according to WHO.
More than 20 outbreaks in other parts of Africa have been much more easily contained, said Dr. Tom Kenyon, who heads the Center for Global Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.
Where those earlier outbreaks have occurred, "the local public knows it is Ebola and takes measures to stop it," Kenyon said. "They stop touching sick people. They stop touching dead bodies and bury them safely. They wash their hands with bleach solutions and don't touch one another. That will stop the outbreak."
Unfamiliar territory
But in West Africa, where the virus previously had not surfaced, even doctors were caught off guard.
"There’s lots of belief that it’s a curse, that a witch came and caused these things to happen to people," said Leisha Nolen, a physician in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service.
As a disease detective, she has gathered research on the epidemic in both Liberia and Sierra Leone. There and in Guinea, she said, civil wars left residents fearful of outsiders and unwilling to work with them or to change practices that spread the disease.
Unlike in the remote areas of Central Africa, people in the three affected countries used to travel freely between rural areas and major cities, as well as across borders.
"Movement is actually a big problem in this outbreak in that people continue to move and continue to expose new populations to the infection," she said in September.
All three countries have since established checkpoints to take temperatures and screen for the Ebola virus.
Travel bands urged, discouraged
Some airlines suspended flights to West Africa, amid calls for travel bans as a few cases were reported in the United States and Spain. But health officials and the United Nations opposed such measures on the grounds that they would further isolate the countries, depriving them of needed medical personnel and supplies and increasing the likelihood of the disease spreading.
As U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at a November 21 news briefing, "We need to avoid travel bans, discrimination against health workers and other steps that would isolate countries when they need help most."
Guinea’s Ministry of Health first formally acknowledged the current outbreak in March.
On March 31, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders warned that the outbreak was "unprecedented" in its geographic spread. In June, the organization's director of operations, Dr. Bart Janssens, issued a stronger statement, saying the outbreak was "out of control" and required a massive infusion of international health workers, resources and equipment to curb its spread.
In August, WHO declared the outbreak "a public health emergency of international concern."
Increased support from US, elsewhere
In September, President Barack Obama announced the United States would ramp up its efforts to fight the epidemic, beefing up humanitarian aid, support for awareness training and medical missions. The Defense Department deployed nearly 3,000 troops to West Africa to speed the delivery of medical personnel and supplies and to build treatment centers in Liberia.
FILE - World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan warns against complacency.
Other countries, organizations and individuals also sent aid.
By mid-December, WHO’s chief, Dr. Margaret Chan, reported signs of hope in some areas – and new outbreaks in others, especially in Sierra Leone.
"We must maintain our vigilance. Complacency would be our enemy," Chan had said a month earlier, noting then that the rate of infection for new cases had slowed. "… We have been successful in bending the curve a bit. But we need to continue to do more to get to zero."
Despite fast-tracking potential Ebola treatments and vaccines, prevention methods plus early treatment and basic care remain the best hope for survival.

Sierra Leone President Koroma ‘Assures’ VP of Protection
Sierra Leone President Earnest Bai Koroma said embattled Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana should not fear for his life or feel threatened by the prevailing conditions in the country, according to government spokesman Abdulai Bayraytay.
Bayraytay said there is no reason why Sam-Sumana should fear for his life, due to the president’s assurance.
Sam-Sumana went into hiding and expressed concern about his safety after his guards were abruptly disarmed and changed without his knowledge or approval.
He reportedly reached out to the American Embassy, seeking asylum. But government spokesman Bayraytay said both the vice president and his wife are safe and secure.
'No reason' to fear for life
“There is no reason for the vice president to fear for his life, the reason being he remains the incumbent vice president. He was only one expelled from the All People’s Congress, the party under whose ticket he came into governance,” Bayraytay said.
“I had a chat with the president who said there is no reason for the vice president to feel threatened, because he can assure his safety and security, and that the issue about him, even saying he wanted political asylum from the U.S. Embassy is a little bit exaggerated, the reason being there is no reason for that,” he added.
But supporters of the vice president said there is an orchestrated effort from the president and the ruling party leadership to humiliate Sam-Sumana. They said as head of the police and other security agencies in the country as enshrined in the constitution, the vice president should have been informed about the impending change of his bodyguards.
Bayraytay disagrees. He said the police administration can change bodyguards without consultations.
“We announced to the public that new security arrangements are being put in place, wherein we have a joint leadership of the Sierra Leone police and the military. They are now in charge of the presidential fleets of guards. The presidents guards were changed just as how any other ministers’ guards were changed,” Bayraytay said.
“When it comes to that it is more of an internal security arrangement and decision undertaken by the Sierra Leone police without having to consult the politicians. So, this is what happened," he added.
"And besides, the vice president is also on [Ebola] quarantine, which means some of those guards that are also in quarantine they need to disarm them so that they can redeploy other people with arms just to ensure continued safety of the vice president himself," the spokesman said.
Ebola Quarantine
Sam-Sumana is currently under self-imposed, 21-day quarantine after one of his guards recently died of Ebola. His supporters have questioned the haste in changing the guards when the leadership of the security agencies could have waited until he completes his quarantine.
But Bayraytay reiterates that it is the duty of the police administration to rotate guards. He said President Koroma reassured the U.S. ambassador to Sierra Leone about the vice president’s safety in a telephone conversation.
“The president has said personally and publicly that there is no course for alarm for the safety of the vice president,” Bayraytay said. “The ambassador to Sierra Leone even called President Koroma and President Koroma in my presence assured him that everything is OK and there is no cause for alarm, and the vice president should continue to live his normal life.”

VOA ‘Town Hall’ Shines Light on Ebola Crisis
WASHINGTON —
Time is of the essence in identifying and treating those infected with the Ebola virus.
That’s the message of a Voice of America “town hall” on the lethal disease, which has infected some 14,500 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea since the current outbreak was identified in March. More than 5,400 of them have died.
The gathering served as a special edition of the weekly Voice of America program "Straight Talk Africa," with several experts discussing the urgency of identifying and treating Ebola.
Dr. Malonga Miatudila helped identify the disease in 1976. Since then, 25 outbreaks have occurred, excluding the current one, and none lasted more than three months. Swift action contained those outbreaks. By the end of 2013, fewer than 2,000 deaths were linked to Ebola.
This time around, Miatudila said, there was a significant time lapse before the public health community and global partners responded to the crisis.
"When it started in Guinea, we waited. We waited, we waited, we waited. We spent time," he said. "We waited more than 100 days before acknowledging we had a problem."
The experts said once the problem was acknowledged, the international community took action and the response to the health crisis improved. They said it’s good now.
Another panelist was Dr. Rick Sacra, the third U.S. citizen to contract Ebola while working in Africa. When he experienced the first symptoms, Sacra was immediately tested and airlifted to the United States for treatment. With modern medical care at a hospital in Nebraska, Sacra survived.
"I received care at a level that is unfortunately not available in Liberia where I was serving," he said. "Our prayer and our effort ... is to bring better care wherever we can, whatever is provided in order to do that."
In countries where Ebola continues to spread, the speakers said one of the biggest challenges is persuading family members and friends of those who have died to abandon traditional funeral and burial practices, which bring them in close contact with their loved ones' bodies – and the virus.
The VOA program’s listeners and viewers were reminded how Ebola is spread: through contact with the contaminated body fluids of people who die. They also were advised to let public health workers handle the bodies of those who have died, and to seek medical care at the first signs of illness.

US Health Official Comments on Evolving Ebola Procedures
WASHINGTON —
A top U.S. health official says it is unrealistic to expect every hospital in America to be able to care for an Ebola patient, but that health care facilities must be vigilant for possible cases and be ready to isolate anyone infected with the virus for transport to specialized treatment centers. The Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, spoke one day after President Barack Obama warned against mass-panic over the disease.
A collective sigh of relief could be felt aboard a cruise ship that docked in Texas after a passenger tested negative for Ebola. A Coast Guard helicopter was dispatched to collect a blood sample from a woman who had handled specimens from America’s first Ebola patient, Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, who died earlier this month in Dallas.
The episode points to mounting fears and evolving health protocols to deal with the virus. Last week, America’s third Ebola patient, Dallas nurse Nina Pham, was transferred to the nation's premier health research facility, the National Institutes of Health near Washington, for treatment. NIH infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci says it’s important to remain realistic.
“I think this idea that every single hospital can take care of a seriously-ill Ebola patient right now is not true. We do not want people to think that any community hospital is totally equipped to care for a patient,” said Fauci, speaking on ABC’s This Week program.
Earlier, President Barack Obama attempted to calm an increasingly-alarmed American public.
“This is a serious disease, but we cannot give in to hysteria or fear. Now, even one infection is too many. At the same time, we have to keep this in perspective. As our public health experts point out, every year thousands of Americans die from the flu,” said Obama.
But a growing chorus of critics, including some Republican and Democrat lawmakers, want stronger measures to isolate the United States from African nations where Ebola has killed more than 4,500 people. Congressman Fred Upton is among them.
“I am going to encourage the president to really put in a no-fly zone from that region of the world, particularly for folks trying to travel here on a visa,” said Upton.
President Obama said stopping flights to and from West Africa could make the situation worse by disrupting the flow of supplies and health workers to affected regions and causing passengers to go through third countries and possibly evade screening for Ebola.

Ebola Outbreak Shows ‘Major Reforms’ Needed
LONDON —
A panel of experts says major reforms of the global health system are needed - if the world is to avoid a repeat of the Ebola epidemic that swept across West Africa in 2014 and early 2015. The investigation – convened by the Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - says the slow response cost thousands of lives.
More than 11,000 people died as the Ebola virus spread across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - with minor outbreaks in a handful of other African countries. The investigation into the global response describes ‘immense human suffering, fear and chaos’ – and criticizes a lack of political leadership.
Professor Peter Piot was part of the team that discovered the Ebola virus in what was then Zaire in 1976, and chaired the report into the latest outbreak.
“We need to support those countries that are most vulnerable to epidemics to build their capacity, so that they can diagnose locally and promptly, and also organize the response through health education and whatever measures have to be put in place," said Piot.
The report says the biggest single failure was the World Health Organization's delay in sounding the alarm on the outbreak.
“And as a result many people died unnecessarily, that could have been prevented. That means a better-equipped and more-efficient and more-responsive WHO, World Health Organization. And also a system that brings more accountability, that we know where the money is going, that we know which states are doing what they promised to do," said Piot.
Since the outbreak, promising vaccines have been developed against Ebola. Piot says thousands of lives could have been saved with earlier investment.
Last month the three worst affected countries celebrated the first week none of them had experienced any new infections. But in recent days there have been several new cases in Liberia.
“We have discovered now, which is something we didn’t know, that people – men – can excrete the virus in their seminal fluid for six or seven months. That there may be persistence of the virus in the body. So all that is very new," he said.
Piot says those new developments make the reforms even more urgent, to prevent a future pandemic.

Report: Ebola Crimping Economic Growth in Some W. African Nations
Ebola is likely to disrupt "critical commercial and transport" activities in affected countries for at least a month, and could hurt government budgeting and economic growth.
The new assessment of Africa's worst-ever outbreak of Ebola comes from the rating agency Moody's. The report says efforts to stop the spread of the deadly virus have prompted officials to close borders, markets, and schools; put non-essential workers on leave and cancel sporting events. The deadly virus has also forced some hospitals to close after Ebola sickened or killed medical staff in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Ebola worries also mean several local and international airlines have cancelled flights to those countries, and some oil companies are moving staff out of the area. The major mining company ArcelorMittal is stopping development of some iron ore operations in Liberia.
The Moody's report says if the small number of Ebola cases in Nigeria become a "significant" outbreak, it could have a "considerable" impact on the nation's vital oil and natural gas operations. Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, and a major oil exporter.
Ebola has killed at least 1,000 people and sickened even more. Experts say it is too early to calculate the cost of the disruptions.

Violent Quarantine Clashes Hamper Liberia's Struggle to Contain Ebola
The Liberian capital swirled with fear and confusion Thursday, as a nationwide nighttime curfew to slow the spread of Ebola went into full effect and a slum neighborhood was violently quarantined off from the rest of city.
With Liberia reporting the most new cases of the deadly virus, the quarantine — an extreme measure rarely seen in public health emergencies anywhere — of the impoverished neighborhood of West Point appeared to be a sign of increasing desperation by the government.
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared a national 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew on Tuesday, as well as West Point’s cordoning off. The timing of the announcement came as a surprise to many Liberians, as well as West Point residents, who clashed with soldiers after barricades made of tables, chairs and barbed wire went up early Wednesday.
“There is reason to be frightened. Everyone should be frightened,” said 52-year-old Emmanuel Davis, a businessman in Monrovia, who spoke to VOA by telephone. “People are past the stage of denial, they are in the stage of fear.”
The World Health Organization said nearly 2,500 people have been infected by the virus in four West African countries, with more than 1,350 people dying from it. Many experts have cautioned that those figures likely undercount the death toll, however.
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have reported cases, though Liberia is worst hit, reporting 90 percent of new deaths.
Some rural parts of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have been subjected to severe travel restrictions, with soldiers manning checkpoints and taking people’s temperatures to check for symptoms of the virus, which is extremely infectious and fatal.
Local and foreign news reports said the price of basic goods in some parts of Monrovia, particularly in West Point, had climbed sharply Wednesday and Thursday.
By Thursday afternoon, however, government officials had arrived with bags of rice, drinking water packets and cooking oil, with hundreds of residents lining up at the distribution point, The Associated Press reported.
Misinformation and Distrust
There was also a growing sense that the effort to halt the disease’s spread was being hampered by misinformation, and persistent distrust toward the government, a fact that Sirleaf alluded to earlier this month in declaring a state of emergency.
"Ignorance and poverty, as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices, continue to exacerbate the spread of the disease,” Sirleaf said.
In West Point, a bustling, peninsular shantytown housing tens hundreds of thousands of people, the government last week had turned an elementary school building into an Ebola ward. But tensions soared after a group of young men armed with clubs rampaged through the center, yelling "there's no Ebola" in Liberia, witnesses reported.
On Wednesday, soldiers erected barricades of barbed wire, wood and furniture to seal off the neighborhood. News reports quoted residents as saying they had no advance notice of the quarantine, and were prevented from getting to work or buying food. At least four people when police fired bullets and tear gas to disperse the stone-throwing protesters.
“I’m telling you live bullets were used. A 15-year-old boy by the name of Sylvester Kromah was shot in the leg by the Liberian army,” Vandalark Patricks, national director of Liberia Campaigners for Change, told VOA. “When he went to rescue one of his family members, who also received a bullet in the process, his leg was shot by … soldiers.”
Defense Ministry Denies Fatal Shooting
Defense Minister Brownie Samukai however denied that, and said soldiers were attacked.
“A group of unruly residents came and began to attack the police and military personnel, throwing rocks, sticks, anything they could put their hands on. And, they went to attack the residence of the district commissioner. It was within the context of that that shots were fired in the air, I repeat, in the air, to disperse the crowds,” he told VOA.
“We have to find the way to cut the spread of the virus. And, the way to cut the spread of the virus is to make sure that we are positioned in a way to identify those who have the sickness and, at the same [time], identify those who need assistance,” Samukai said.
West Point residents were also angered that soldiers sought to free the district’s head commissioner, who had been held hostage by people upset by the quarantine, Patricks said.
“The commissioner, being a resident of that community, decided to leave with the help of some higher ups to go to another area. So, the residents said you cannot leave us here because the law does not exclude anyone,” he said.
Ebola’s rapid spread through Liberia has been fueled not only distrust of government messages, but also mistaken beliefs that folk remedies could stop or cure the disease, said Alfred Goumorlor, who runs a non-government organization in Monrovia called Critical Thinking Liberia.
“Many people said the government was lying, the government was trying to make money and because of that, the government wasn’t able to take immediate action to quarantine local communities,” he said.
South Africa Announces Travel Ban
Some other African countries have also begun imposing travel bans to the three afflicted West African nations; South Africa on Thursday became the latest to impose such a restriction. With some airlines canceling flights to the countries, fears are also growing that disappearance of badly needed tourists will weaken the countries’ fragile economies.
Guinea has started deploying civilian and military medical officers to its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia as part of efforts to contain the virus.
According to WHO, fruit bats are the likeliest host for the virus. In the current outbreak, the majority of human cases have occurred as a result of human-to-human transmission from contact with blood, urine or saliva or contact with contaminated bed linens or clothing.

Cuban Doctors Fight Ebola on Front Line in Sierra Leone
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE —
A Cuban doctor working in Sierra Leone has contracted Ebola and is being flown to Geneva for treatment. The doctor is one of 165 medical personnel Cuba sent to Sierra Leone to help fight the Ebola epidemic. The infection occurred despite intensive training the Cubans after arriving in Freetown.
The training for the Cuban medical staff in Freetown was organized through the World Health Organization (WHO). One goal was to reduce the dangers to the medical workers.
A WHO spokesperson in Freetown, Winnie Romeril, said there will be a thorough investigation of how the doctor contracted the deadly virus.
“Accidental exposures happen in every country in the world. They are particularly hazardous when dealing with a pathogen like Ebola," said Romeril. "We’re going to look into what happened here, and if it’s a systemic problem, we’ll look to change that. If there’s something we can do at the front end to better prepare, we’ll do that as well, but right now we don’t know what happened with this individual.”
Rigorous training
The training the Cubans receive in Sierra Leone is twofold. They practice the proper use of personal protective equipment, or PPE. And to simulate experiences the medical staff may face, Ebola survivors reenact scenes of what they actually went through as Ebola patients.
Benon Tumwebeze, a trainer for the Cuban teams in Sierra Leone, said, “We want health workers to get insight, that if you get a patient -- how do you handle them? So we present cases Ebola patients normally go through like vomiting, diarrhea, some of them are confused. So we have such cases and each case has a learning point.”
Some of the Cubans are working in Kerry Town, just outside Freetown, where an Ebola treatment center was built. Others are still in training.
Cuban medical worker Jose Benito Garcia said it is Cuba’s duty to come to West Africa and stop the worst Ebola outbreak in history.
“It’s our tradition in Cuba," said Garcia, "that we stand in solidarity with places that don’t have resources to handle crisis like this. Sierra Leone is one of those places.”
Garcia added that the additional training on site through the WHO is helpful because it is hard to know what to expect from Ebola patients.
Yoel Bernal Ferrera has a similar view of the training. “From a professional point of view, it’s important for me because it is a new experience -- but the most important is that we can help people who need our help.”
Ebola survivor Mohamed Turay is glad to help in the training by playing the role of an Ebola patient.
"It is important, because I don’t want any [more] members of my family or country to lose their life, so this is important that they [medical workers] are able to manage these cases, they are difficult cases,” said Turay.
Exacting requirements
The medical staff also had training in the use of personal protection equipment back in Cuba.
The most challenging aspect is putting on and taking off the gear, and dealing with the heat while wearing PPE, said Cuban nurse Julio Ramirez, who just started work at the Kerry Town treatment center. The slightest slip could result in an Ebola infection.
“It’s very hot, the PPE’s, to be inside the ward, no more than maybe 40-45 minutes,” said Ramirez.
There are three Cuban teams in Sierra Leone, and a total of 256 medical professionals from Cuba in West Africa to help stop the spread of Ebola.
More than 5,000 people have died during this outbreak among more than 14,400 confirmed cases worldwide.

Liberian Man in Nigeria Being Tested for Ebola
LAGOS —
A Liberian man in his 40s is being tested for the deadly Ebola virus in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, a megacity of 21 million people, the Lagos State Health Ministry said on Thursday.
Ebola has killed 632 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since an outbreak began in February, straining a string of weak health systems despite international help.
This would be the first recorded case of one of the world's deadliest diseases in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and most populous nation with 170 million people.
Nigeria has some of the continent's least adequate health infrastructure for a nation of its size, despite access to billions of dollars of oil money as Africa's biggest oil producer.
The special adviser on public health to the Lagos state government, Yewande Adeshina, told a news conference the man had arrived in Lagos from Liberia on Sunday.
“The patient was admitted and detained on suspicion of possible EBV [Ebola] infection, while blood sample collection and testing was initiated,” she said in her statement.
Samples had been sent to a World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory in Dakar, she said, adding that “results are pending.”
The Ebola outbreak started in Guinea's remote southeast and has since spread across the region's poorly controlled borders. Symptoms of the highly infectious disease are diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.

Sierra Leone Athletes Try to Regain Stride After Halting for Ebola
FREETOWN —
The Ebola crisis brought everything to a grinding halt in Sierra Leone last year when it was at its peak. This included sports. Public gatherings were banned, and that meant teams couldn’t practice properly. Many athletes were also denied visas to compete abroad.
Marathon runner Idrissa Kargbo is worried about his future career partly because of the Ebola crisis.
He holds the national marathon record in Sierra Leone at two hours, 32 minutes, and has run in the London and New York City Marathons over the past two years.
Now, he has a chance to go to Cape Town, South Africa, to compete in a marathon in September. But he’s concerned he will be denied a visa.
“I am worried a little bit because I don’t know what’s going to come, since I’m in an [Ebola-]affected country,” he said.
Other athletes have been denied visas due to the Ebola situation, according to Mohamed Vangahun, technical director of the Sierra Leone volleyball team.
His team lost its chance to compete in the Youth Olympic Games last year in China.
“We were hoping to represent Africa in that championship, unfortunately we were denied visas by the Chinese embassy and could not take part, of course it was not good for our players. Imagine they have trained over two months for that competition,” said Vangahun.
But the players are not letting that get them down too much.
“We are still determined, we have the spirit, we have the ambition, the determination,” said Florence Amara, the team captain.
That attitude of determination may pay off.
A Sierra Leone boxing team was recently granted a visa to compete next month in the United States.
That gives athletes like Kargbo and Amara hope, especially since Ebola cases in the country have decreased generally, except for a few small areas.
Now the big challenge is getting back up to speed on their own game.
Until recently, public gatherings of more than 10 people were banned to prevent the spread of Ebola.
That means teams had to make do with fewer players, said Amara.
“It affected me as a captain, because I was not be able to see the kind of competitiveness I like to see in training, I’m not seeing all the techniques from players because some players have been left out, so the pressure is on me,” she said.
Kargbo is still concerned about catching the virus, so he runs alone for now.
“I miss the social aspect, because I used to train with my friends,” he said.
He also hopes more financial assistance will be offered to athletes like him who mainly rely on international support.
And, like Amara, he is not giving up and hopes to compete at the Olympics games in Rio in 2016.

World Bank Sees $3B-$4B Ebola Impact in Africa
A World Bank official says the Ebola epidemic will not be as costly to West Africa's economy as previously feared, thanks to effective containment efforts.
Francisco Ferreira, the bank's chief economist for Africa, told an audience in Johannesburg Wednesday that he expects the epidemic’s economic toll on the region will range from $3 to $4 billion.
The World Bank in October had predicted the economic impact could be as high as $32 billion if the virus spread significantly outside the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries hardest hit by the outbreak.
"The risk of the highest case of economic impact of Ebola has been reduced because of the success of containment in some countries," Ferreira said, according to the Reuters news agency. "It has not gone to zero because a great level of preparedness and focus is still needed."
Ferreira said efforts to keep the outbreak from spreading to other African countries were largely successful. Senegal and Nigeria reported cases of the disease but have since been declared Ebola-free. Mali is now seeking to contain a small outbreak.
The earlier, more dire prediction reflected worries that if Ebola were to spread more vigorously beyond the three countries at the outbreak's epicenter, it would devastate cross-border trade, supply chains and tourism, Reuters reported.
But the "fear factor" has spread well beyond the outbreak’s actual range, Ferreira said, noting it has deterred tourists from Kenya, South Africa and other countries otherwise unaffected by the contagion.
Ferreira said falling global oil prices, which have dropped by almost a third since June, also has fueled instability among African oil producers, Reuters reported. Nigeria is the continent’s largest exporter of crude oil.
The World Health Organization last week reported a slight rise in the Ebola death toll, saying there have been 5,177 deaths among 14,413 confirmed cases worldwide.

WHO Shuts Ebola Lab in Sierra Leone
The World Health Organization has shut one of its Ebola testing labs in Sierra Leone after a staff member there was infected by the virus.
The WHO said Tuesday it has withdrawn its staff from the lab in Kailahun — one of only two in Sierra Leone — after a Senegalese epidemiologist was infected with the deadly virus. The move could adversely affect efforts to contain the worst ever outbreak of the disease.
Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people and sickened more than 2,600 in West Africa since the outbreak began in March.
Among the worst affected countries are Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, where the government has sealed off an entire slum in the capital Monrovia.
In Liberia, where the highest number of deaths has been reported, some government officials are fleeing the country or just not reporting for work. The situation drove President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Tuesday to order all ministers to return to work.
Liberian officials said several ministers who defied the order had been fired.
Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, offered a cautionary assessment of the outbreak while meeting with officials in Liberia.
Some information for this report comes from AP, AFP and Reuters.

Ebola Studies Help Demystify Vulnerability
Two notable studies on Ebola this week shed more light on why some people are devastated by the virus, while others manage to survive the deadly pathogen.
In one, researchers gathered data from 106 Ebola-stricken patients at the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone from May 25 to July 18. The records of some of the patients were burned due to fears of contamination. But the team was able to thoroughly analyze the data from 44 Ebola patients at the hospital.
"This is the first time anybody has had this much data collected on any Ebola patients,” Dr. John Schieffelin, one of the study’s authors, told Reuters.
The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that age and the amount of virus in a given patient’s blood appeared to be determining factors in the mortality rate of patients. Researchers reported that 57 percent of people under age 21 who were treated for Ebola died from their infections, compared with 94 percent of those over the age of 45.
In terms of viral load, scientists reported that 33 percent of patients with less virus (less than 100,000 copies of the virus per milliliter of blood) at the time of diagnosis ultimately died, compared with a 94 percent mortality rate in those whose blood contained more than 10 million copies per milliliter.
Overall, 74 percent of the patients in the study died, similar to what has been seen in prior outbreaks.
Genetic influence
In the second study, published in the journal Science, scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle found that laboratory mice, like humans, have a range of responses to the virus.
The team was able to breed mice that developed infections like those found in humans. In the Ebola-infected mice, researchers observed a gamut of outcomes, all the way from minor illness to hemorrhagic bleeding and death.
The scientists identified two genes -- TEK and TIE1 -- in mice that appear to be key in predicting which mouse would die and whether one would become ill at all. In mice that bled, the two genes made their blood vessels weaker and prone to leaking, setting off a chain of responses that caused organs to shut down.
The results may explain why some two-thirds of people who die from Ebola never experience hemorrhaging, findings that were described as a 'significant advance' by Dr. James Musser, a director of infectious disease research at Houston Methodist Research Institute, who was quoted in the New York Times.
The team’s research began three years ago, inspired by its work on the history of the influenza virus, long before the current epidemic in three West African countries.

Obama: Ebola Threat to 'Regional, Global Security'
Continuing White House efforts to combat the outbreak of Ebola in Africa, U.S. President Barack Obama warned a summit of world leaders in New York on Thursday that the disease is becoming "a growing threat to regional and global security."
Addressing the special United Nations meeting on the outbreak, Obama called efforts to stop the virus from spreading "in the interests of the entire world."
"In Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, public health systems are near collapse. Economic growth is slowing dramatically," he said. "If this epidemic is not stopped, this disease could cause a humanitarian catastrophe across the region."
Citing recent U.N. commitments to fight the virus, Obama acknowledged some progress but said "it's not enough."
"There's a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be," he said, calling on international organizations, member states, foundations and businesses to mobilize resources and offer support.
"And more citizens — of all nations — can educate themselves on this crisis, contribute to relief efforts and call on their leaders to act," he said. "Everyone can do something."
He then called on U.N. member states to heed calls from the "front lines" for increased medical supplies and aid.
"Right now, patients are being left to die in the streets because there’s nowhere to put them and no one to help them," he said. "One health worker in Sierra Leone compared fighting this outbreak to 'fighting a forest fire with spray bottles.' With our help, they can put out the blaze."
His comments come on the heels of a new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report Tuesday that between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa could be infected with the Ebola virus by January 20, 2015.
Based on the assumption that the actual number of Ebola cases has been underreported, the CDC said in a statement that "extensive, immediate actions — such as those already started — can bring the epidemic to a tipping point to start a rapid decline in cases."
The agency's best-case model projects that by getting 70 percent of patients into facilities where the risk for transmission is reduced and burying the dead safely, the epidemic would be "almost ended" by January 20.
“Stopping Ebola is a priority for the United States,” Obama said. “We will continue to lead and do our part. But this must also be a priority for the world.”
The president then announced a Friday meeting of 44 nations in Washington aimed at advancing global health security. "And we will work with any country that shares that commitment," he said.
$1B US plan; World Bank commitments
The president announced last week a $1 billion-plus U.S. plan to help West African nations contain Ebola. "We need a broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilize economies, and move rapidly across borders," Obama said during his speech to the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday.
"It’s easy to see this as a distant problem — until it is not. And that is why we will continue to mobilize other countries to join us in making concrete commitments, significant commitments to fight this outbreak, and enhance our system of global health security for the long term," the president added.
The U.S. has deployed doctors, scientists and military personnel to help "contain the outbreak and pursue new treatments," Obama said.
According to the World Health Organization, the exponential spread of the Ebola has now killed almost 3,000 people in West Africa.
WHO Director Margaret Chan told the conference a special U.N. mission to fight the outbreak "is in full emergency mode." But she said the "fast-moving epidemic" will get worse before it gets better. Chan pleaded with world leaders "to turn this epidemic around."
Also Thursday, the world's most developed economies pledged to keep open air and sea links with Ebola-hit countries, saying much needed help had to be able to reach those nations battling the epidemic.
The foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States warned that in order to be able to overcome the deadly virus, "affected countries must not be isolated."
Meanwhile, the World Bank says it is giving another $170 million to the West African nations hardest hit by the disease to help them contain its spread, adding to the $230 million it had already approved.
WHO officials said the situation is deteriorating in Sierra Leone and its capital, Freetown, as well as in the Liberian capital of Monrovia. According to news reports by The Associated Press, Sierra Leone on Thursday sealed off an area that is home to more than one million people as part of efforts to keep the virus from spreading.
"The newly declared quarantine areas mean that about one-third of the country's six million people are now living in areas where their movements are heavily restricted," the report said.
Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf took part in Thursday's U.N. meeting via teleconference.
MSF Chief: 'Ebola winning'
Addressing Thursday's meeting with a prepared statement, Dr. Joanne Liu, International President of Doctors Without Borders, echoed portions of Obama's speech, saying "generous pledges of aid and unprecedented UN resolutions" aren't enough.
"They will mean little unless they are translated into immediate action," she said. "The reality on the ground today is this: the promised surge has not yet delivered."
Demanding immediate action on promises to establish isolation centers, she painted a grim picture of a region where "Today, Ebola is winning."
"Fear and panic have set in as infection rates double every three weeks," she said, adding that stressed care facilities are unable to respond to even basic medical needs. "Mounting numbers are dying of other diseases, like malaria, because health systems have collapsed."
Calling complacency a "worse enemy than the virus," she urged leaders to capitalize on "a political momentum the world has rarely—if ever—seen."
"As world leaders, you will be judged by how you use it," she said.
Also Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry announced the appointment of Ambassador Nancy Powell to lead the Ebola Coordination Unit at the Department of State.
According to statement by State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, Powell, who most recently served as U.S. Ambassador to India, "served as the State Department’s Senior Coordinator for Avian Influenza."
"Ambassador Powell will lead the State Department’s outreach to international partners, including foreign governments, to ensure a speedy and truly global response to this crisis," Psaki said.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is hosting Thursday's gathering of world leaders aimed at rallying efforts to contain the outbreak, prevent future ones and treat those who are infected.

AU to Deploy Second Wave of Health Professionals in Ebola Fight
The deputy chairman of the African Union Commission says more than 200 medical professionals will be deployed Thursday to the three West African countries battling the Ebola outbreak.
Erastus Mwencha says the AU is committed to sending at least 1,000 trained health workers by the end of the year to help in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The group of 200 workers will join an earlier contingent of 100 that was deployed equally in the three affected countries, according to Mwencha.
“The latest contingent, which would be flagged off [Thursday] hopefully, is from Nigeria. Over 200 who are going to join the group that is already there to support those governments and the people of those countries to fight Ebola,” said Mwencha.
Reports suggest the Ebola outbreak is still raging in Sierra Leone despite efforts to contain the virus. The World Health Organization estimates that Ebola has killed over 6,000 people, almost all of them in the three West African nations.
Mwencha expressed concern that the international community’s response to help fight the disease has been slow.
He said the pace of the response from governments and the international community picked up, however, after experts predicted more than a million people could be infected by early next year.
“If you look at what is on the ground, in Liberia the situation has stabilized thanks to the efforts of the government and the international community that has supported. In Guinea the rate of infection has gone down. It is only in Sierra Leone where we have a few pockets where we have still infection escalating, but even that there is a lot of efforts to try and contain it,” he said.
Mwencha said the African Union is coordinating efforts with the private sector as part of its commitment to contain the outbreak.
“The private sector in one sitting pledged $30 million. Some of this money is what we are using for this contingent that is being sent tomorrow, the rest of it of course for other contingents,” said Mwencha.
“The telecommunication companies launched an SMS [text message] to fight Ebola where ordinary citizens would be able to send one dollar, [or] five cents, 20 cents as their contributions to fight Ebola. So there is commitment as you can see from government level, at corporate level [and] at individual citizens’ level, so Africa is very much committed,” he said.

Ebola Fatalities in West Africa Reach 83
The death toll from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has risen to 83.
The World Health Organization says all 83 deaths have occurred in Guinea, where there are a total 127 suspected and confirmed cases of the disease.
It says the case number includes 14 health care workers, eight of whom have died.
The WHO says there are also eight suspected and confirmed Ebola cases in neighboring Liberia. It says the person whose diagnosis was confirmed by lab results has been put in isolation, and the people she had contact with are under medical observation.
Ebola is a highly infectious disease, spread mainly through contact with bodily fluids.
Health experts are warning people in the affected areas to wash their hands and avoid contact with Ebola victims in order to keep the disease from spreading.
The outbreak began in southeastern Guinea in February. The first cases in Guinea's capital, Conakry, were confirmed last week.
Last Saturday, Senegal closed the land border it shares with Guinea as a preventative measure.

Liberian President Ends State of Emergency
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is ending the state of emergency she instituted because of the Ebola crisis.
In a speech Thursday, Sirleaf said the fight against Ebola is not over and that some restrictions will remain in place.
"Until the national goal of zero new cases by Christmas is achieved all across the country, we will keep many of the previous measures in place with appropriate adjustments consistent with the progress in our fight," she said.
The Liberian president said markets can reopen, and a curfew will be pushed back to midnight in non-affected areas. She said "hot spots" for the virus continue to appear in rural areas, but the worst may be over.
Sirleaf said 10 of Liberia's 15 counties have reported no new cases since Sunday.
Liberia had been under a state of emergency since August. Of the three African nations where the outbreak has been centered, along with Guinea and Sierra Leone, Liberia is the worst-hit by the epidemic.
News, however, was bleak from Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization says there has been a "steep increase" in the number of Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, with 421 new infections being reported this week.
One of Mali's leading Ebola clinics in the capital, Bamako, was forced to go on lockdown, following the death of a nurse. More than 90 people have been quarantined.
MSF launches clinical trials
Meanwhile, international health group Doctors Without Borders is launching clinical trials in West Africa to test the effectiveness of three potential Ebola treatments.
The group announced Thursday it hopes to begin the trials next month with the first results available as early as February.
Doctors Without Borders is partnering with three other organizations to conduct the separate trials, two of which involve antiviral drugs.
The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research will test a drug called favipiravir at an Ebola treatment center in Guinea. The University of Oxford will test the other drug, called brincidofovir, at a site that has not been chosen yet.
In the final trial, the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine will test how well Ebola patients respond when given blood or plasma that contains antibodies from people who have survived the virus.
Doctors Without Borders says all of the patients in the trials will be informed about any potential risks and consent to the therapy.
It is also urging drug manufacturers to ramp up their supplies even before the trials end so that any treatments found to be effective can be applied without a delay.
The World Health Organization said Wednesday there have been 5,160 reported deaths in the outbreak and more than 14,000 total cases.

Some Ebola Victims Concerned They'll Never Get International Aid
MONROVIA —
Liberia’s reputation for graft has international donors and many Liberians concerned that aid money pouring in to help the country recover from Ebola may disappear into the maw of corruption.
The international community has pledged nearly $5 billion to help West Africa fight and recover from the Ebola outbreak. But systemic fraud and mismanagement in Liberia has donors concerned the people who need the money most won’t see it.
Liberia Deputy Information Minister Isaac Jackson said his government has taken these concerns into account and the international community should be reassured.
“We’ve been able to put in place some of the best measures in accounting for the Ebola money," said Jackson. "As we speak, the minister of finance and development planning, the Honorable Amara Konneh, has challenged all ministries and agencies that received Ebola money to carry out proper accountability, meaning they will have to account for Ebola money.”
Rampant corruption
Many Liberians, however, remain skeptical. The country is notorious for corruption, which keeps almost every part of society in its grip. Even President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s own family has been tainted by graft allegations.
Now, the United States Agency for International Development [USAID] has sent an auditing team to Liberia to look into Ebola projects. This pleases many Liberians who think the team will hold the Liberian government accountable.
The U.S. effort, however, has a different mission, according to Doug Mercado, the leader of USAID’s special response in the fight against Ebola in West Africa. He said it is neither a financial audit nor an audit of the Liberian government.
“This is a standard routine audit that USAID regularly conducts in any kind of situation throughout the world," he said. "It’s a performance audit just to work with our partner to make sure that the program they ran with our funding was achieving the objectives that we set out to achieve initially. So it’s just some routine monitoring to make sure that what we set out to do we’re actually doing, and doing effectively.”
Mercado did not say which particular projects in Liberia will be monitored. U.S. assistance to combat Ebola in West Africa - administered through USAID, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. military - stands at more than $1.3 billion.
Tracking money
Silas Siakor is the founder of SDI, a local research institute that has for years monitored misuse of money in Liberia’s mining, forestry, and agriculture sectors. He said a financial audit of U.S. assistance would be very welcome because it’s not always the Liberian government that wastes money.
“We have seen a lot of waste in the natural resource sector. USAID money going to U.S. agencies working in the natural resource sector," said Siakor. "Millions of dollars. And we’re seeing extremely limited impact on the ground. So we’re very concerned that a lot of the money that was appropriated by the U.S. government for Ebola response could end up similarly where it leaves nothing behind in the public health sector in Liberia.”
According to Siakor, the U.S. government has spent about $25 million to protect Liberian communities from lumber companies who sometimes cut down all the trees and leave the land barren. Given that amount, he has seen very little improvement for the communities where the aid money was aimed.
Siakor said a lot of aid money also goes into the salaries and housing costs of foreign development staff. The majority of aid agencies are based in Monrovia, the capital. Liberia is one of the poorest countries in Africa, but a simple room with running water and stable electricity in Monrovia easily costs $1,000 per month; a good hotel room can go for $100 per night.

WHO: Guinea, Liberia Meeting Targets to Curb Ebola
Transmission of the Ebola virus is slowing in West Africa, with Liberia and Guinea meeting December 1 goals that at least 70 percent of the sick have been isolated and at least 70 percent of burials are handled safely, a World Health Organization official reported Monday.
"Many communities are changing the way that they live," Bruce Aylward, WHO’s assistant director general, said at a news conference in Geneva.
Liberia has experienced a steep drop in the number of new cases and Guinea has seen a leveling off, Aylward said. But in Sierra Leone, the third most-affected country, the rate has been increasing since October 1, when the United Nations health organization set its targets.
However, Aylward said the country was likely to contain the outbreak, with increased surveillance and new treatment facilities expected to open within a few weeks, easing the bed shortage in its western region.
"Capacity at the district level is strong and getting stronger in Sierra Leone, and that's why I think the prognosis is actually very good," he said.
Some mismatches remain
Questioned about a mismatch between resources and needs, Aylward acknowledged that the situation is "not perfect." The Ebola treatment units are big facilities, some with 100 beds, but often are far from where prospective patients live.
In Guinea, he said, the virus had been detected in nine prefectures in early October and now was in 16. But major treatment facilities are only in two locations: Conakry, the capital city, and Gueckedou, an area in the forest region where the outbreak began almost a year ago.
"The big thing is getting the geographic build-out right," Aylward said.
While there has been progress, that’s not good enough to stop Ebola, Aylward said. "There is no room for optimism as long as you are dealing with an Ebola virus."
Continued vigilance needed
Ending the epidemic will require isolating 100 percent of the sick and safely burying 100 percent of the dead, he added. It also will take sustained vigilance.
The slowdown in the spread of disease can create a dangerous complacency, Aylward said. On a recent trip to Liberia, he said he saw fewer containers with chlorine bleach solutions for people to wash hands and saw "people cramming into taxis again."
"Now you’re going to need surveillance teams in every single prefecture" to trace infected people's contacts, he said, to systematically "hunt the virus rather than be hunted by it."

Ebola Crisis: Sierra Leone Health Workers Strike
More than 400 health workers involved in treating Ebola patients have gone on strike at a clinic in Sierra Leone.
The staff, who include nurses, porters and cleaners, are protesting about the government's failure to pay an agreed weekly $100 (£63) "hazard payment".
The clinic, in Bandajuma near Bo, is the only Ebola treatment center in southern Sierra Leone.
In Mali, a nurse and the patient he was treating earlier became the second and third people to die from Ebola there.
Nearly 5,000 people have been killed in the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
The Bandajuma clinic is run by medical charity MSF, which said it would be forced to close the facility if the strike continued.
MSF's emergency coordinator in Sierra Leone, Ewald Stars, told the BBC that about 60 patients had been left unattended because of the strike at the clinic in Bandajuma.
There are international staff at the clinic but they are unable to keep the clinic open on their own.
Mohamed Mbawah, a representative of the striking Sierra Leonean staff, told the BBC his colleagues had already turned away one ambulance.
The staff, who are protesting outside the clinic, say the government agreed to the "hazard payments" when the facility was established but has failed to make any payments since September.
The money was due to be paid in addition to salaries the staff receive from MSF.
Traditional healer
Earlier, the Malian authorities confirmed that a nurse and the patient he was treating at a clinic in Bamako had died.
The patient, a traditional Muslim healer in his 50s, had recently arrived from Guinea.
The current outbreak is the deadliest since Ebola was discovered in 1976
He had been treated by the nurse, 25, at the Pasteur Clinic, which has now been placed in quarantine.
The deaths are unrelated to Mali's first Ebola case, when a two-year-old girl died from the disease in October.
The new cases in Mali follow the WHO's confirmation that 25 of the 100 people who were thought to have come into contact with the two-year-old girl were being released from quarantine.
The toddler's case alarmed the authorities in Mali after it was found she had displayed symptoms whilst travelling through the country by bus, including Bamako, on her return from neighboring Guinea.
Emergency response
Ebola was first identified in Guinea in March, before it spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. The WHO says there are now more than 13,240 confirmed, suspected and probable cases, almost all in these countries.
Cases have also emerged, though on a much smaller scale, in Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the U.S.
Mali launched an emergency response in conjunction with the WHO when the girl's situation came to light. Her family were among those released from quarantine on Monday.
Health department spokesman Markatie Daou said around 50 people were still under observation in Kayes, western Mali, and would be released in a week if they continued to display no symptoms.
Meanwhile, the virus is continuing to spread in Sierra Leone, with almost 300 new infections recorded in the last three days.
Because of the size and seriousness of the Ebola outbreak, VOA and BBC are collaborating in order to give audiences in Africa and around the world access to the best information and content available.

Report: Ebola Fueled by Distrust
As health officials in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone struggle to eliminate the final cases of Ebola, a new report said some hard lessons have been learned. The group International Alert says a lack of trust between the Liberian people and their government made the outbreak worse
The report’s author, Ashoka Mukpo, said that “many people mistrust official institutions and even feel threatened by them.”
Mukpo, an American, is an Ebola survivor himself. He contracted the disease last year in Monrovia.
“It was a bad couple of weeks. I was very, very sick. I’ve never been that sick in my life and I was quite scared.”
After being treated for five days in Liberia, he was airlifted to a medical facility in the U.S. state of Nebraska.
The International Alert report is entitled Surviving Ebola: Public Perceptions of Governance and the Outbreak Response in Liberia.
“International Alert is an organization that looks at underlying dynamics to maintain peace in fragile states. And one of the things we’re really curious about with the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is how much did people’s perceptions toward government contribute to the outbreak? And what we found when we talked to people is that there were very high levels of mistrust and suspicion towards the government’s motives. And this was really what underpinned people’s initial refusal to take their warning seriously about how deadly Ebola was,” said Mukpo.
The mistrust, he said, stemmed from history and unfulfilled expectations.
“On one hand, Liberia has quite a history of tension between citizens and government. It had a civil war about 15 years ago. But I think right now what people felt is that there is this tremendous sense of hope. That with President Johnson Sirleaf’s election this would mean development and accountability for corruption and these kinds of things. And the results actually have been quite disappointing. So, people are savvy enough to see that what they were hoping would happen hasn’t actually happened.”
Mukpo said Liberians had expected more from the healthcare system when the Ebola outbreak took hold.
“People felt like so many millions of dollars have gone into aid and development over the past 10 years. With the health sector that completely collapsed so quickly, there was this perception that, well, there must have been some kind of corruption – that people were taking money and not putting it into places it was supposed to go. So, fair or not, if you look at the record of this government in battling corruption, it’s been so poor that even if there were much bigger issues, you know, with how hard it is to fight an Ebola outbreak people’s perceptions automatically went to corruption.”
He said, however, perceptions were not the same for the international community.
“You know, actually, I was really surprised by this. As someone who lived in Liberia for a few years I really expected that the levels of trust in the international community would have been equally as low as the government. Because, you know, I’ve heard people say, well, these are the folks who support this government [in] the way that they act. But actually the levels of trust that were given to the international community were much higher than the government. In fact, most of the remarks in most of the reports on the international community’s performance during Ebola, and just, in general, its concern for Liberians, was very high,” said Mukpo.
He said that “one of the critical and under reported narratives” of Liberia’s Ebola crisis involved community leaders.
“Initially, there was this really authoritative effort to quarantine communities and force them to do things differently. And it kind of didn’t work. And what really worked is once you sat down with communities – and once the government actually got to community leaders and said, look, what can we do to assist you in fighting this outbreak? What do you need from us and what can you do to help? Then once that kind of collaborative effort started, then that’s really when you started to see cases reduce,” he said.
Mukpo said community trust played a major role in the safe burial of Ebola victims. Touching and washing dead bodies helped spread the disease, despite government warnings against the traditional practice.
“Really, when you’ve got community volunteers involved, these are the people whose neighbors doing these secret burials – whose neighbors were hiding the sick. So, it’s much easier to hide somebody from an official who doesn’t live in your neighborhood than from someone who grew up 30 yards away. They come and knock on your door and say, you know, look, I hear your sister is sick. We need to take her to the clinic. And I really think that was the tipping point – that once it was people that folks trusted and that knew had their best interests in mind, that that’s really when people started to be more cooperative and change their behavior,” he said.
The International Alert report said, “Post-Ebola policy-making and aid delivery must take into account the need to repair the bonds between Liberians and their government, in order to strengthen good governance and accountability.” It added that “projects that seek to strengthen health services, promote good governance and rebuild service delivery must incorporate civil society and…communities into planning and decision-making.”
It also recommended that security forces exercise restraint during demonstrations and protests, that anti-corruption agencies be strengthened, and that the Liberian government support a free press and civil society.

MSF: W. African Ebola 'Out of Control'
The international medical charity Doctors without Borders says the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is out of control and not enough is being done to isolate those who may have the virus.
Officials say they have found hundreds of cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and that hundreds have died.
Doctors say they have reached their limit of what can be done to fight the outbreak. They say there is fear and a lack of understanding in local communities of how the disease spreads.
The group, known by its French acronym MSF, says some people become infected at funerals, where controls have not been implemented. It also blames the spread on people moving around looking for treatment and visiting family members.
Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization are providing medical and other support to health ministries to help them fight the disease.
The highly contagious and extremely deadly illness is named for the river in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There is no known specific treatment.

World Leaders to Tackle IS, Ebola During UN Meetings
UNITED NATIONS —
Against the grim backdrop of global terrorism and a deadly health crisis, world leaders will convene in New York this week for their annual gathering at the U.N. General Assembly. The terrorist group calling itself the Islamic State (also known as ISIL or ISIS), and efforts to control the spread of the Ebola virus, are expected to dominate discussions.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the international community will focus on addressing the violence in Iraq and Syria, which have become a breeding ground for extremist groups, most notably Islamic State militants.
“I welcome the growing international consensus to act against this serious threat to global and regional peace and security," Ban said.
Last Friday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry chaired a ministerial-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Iraq, in which he thanked the dozens of countries that have offered critical commitments to this fight against Islamic State militants.
“ISIL poses a threat to all of us, and we are committed to working in close partnership with the new Iraqi government and countries around the world to defeat it," he said.
A centerpiece of that effort will be a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting chaired by U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday about the rise of foreign terrorist fighters. Leaders will discuss stopping the flow of finances to radicals and ways to counter violent extremism.
New York University professor Richard Gowan says the meeting is intended to send an important political message.
“President Obama has put together a coalition of 40 countries to fight ISIS. At the U.N. he will be reaffirming that struggle. Actually, most of the hard work has been done already, but the U.N. is a good stage to talk about the need to fight the Islamists," he said.
Ebola
Also high on the international agenda will be containing the fast-moving outbreak of the Ebola virus, which has killed about half of the more than 5,000 people infected with it in West Africa.
The U.N. chief announced last week that he is creating a special health mission to deal with the virus that will mobilize human, material, logistic and financial resources to affected countries.
“This is not just a health crisis. It has grave humanitarian, economic and social consequences that could spread far beyond the affected countries," Ban said.
Crises in Africa, the conflict in Ukraine and the aftermath of the 50-day war in the Gaza Strip are other issues that will be discussed by the leaders. The secretary-general also is convening a summit on climate change to urge that countries make commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
NYU’s Gowan says the past year has been an especially difficult one for the international community, with diplomatic fights over Syria and Ukraine. But he notes the challenges from Islamic State and Ebola provide common ground for governments to agree. He predicts there will be a big push to try to restore some international unity after a divisive year.

US Ebola Patient Deteriorates to Critical Condition
An American health care worker being treated for Ebola deteriorated to critical condition on Monday.
The unnamed patient is being treated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in suburban Washington, which shared the status report. The patient was flown to the clinic Friday from Sierra Leone, after testing positive for the Ebola virus. The patient, a clinician, had been volunteering with the medical charity Partners in Health at a treatment unit.
On Sunday, 10 health care workers who came in contact with the patient in Sierra Leone also were flown to the United States via noncommercial aircraft, Partners in Care said. All were staying near hospitals with high-level biocontainment units capable of treating Ebola, in case they became sick.
Reuters news agency said four were being monitored by doctors from the Nebraska Medical Center, and one of them had been admitted to its containment unit Sunday evening after showing symptoms. Most of those symptoms have subsided.
"At this point, this person has not tested positive for the Ebola virus," Reuters quoted Dr. Phil Smith, the biocontainment unit’s medical director, as saying.
The health care workers have voluntarily isolated themselves during the remainder of the 21-day Ebola incubation period, Partners in Health said.
Other clinicians are staying near the NIH center in Bethesda, Maryland, and Emery University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. All of the hospitals previously have treated patients with Ebola.
The deadly virus has killed 10,144 people, almost entirely in the West African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, according to the World Health Organization’s latest report. At least 24,340 people have been infected with Ebola since the West African outbreak began in December 2013.

Five Patients Given Experimental Ebola Drug Said To Be Improving
The World Health Organization has approved the use of experimental treatments for Ebola patients in West Africa. The Ebola outbreak there is unprecedented, the disease deadly. The number of people who have died from Ebola has surpassed 1,200. There are ethical considerations of allowing experimental drugs to be used.
Without specific drugs or a vaccine for Ebola, the only thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease is treat their symptoms and hope their bodies can fight the virus.
Ebola is killing at least half of those who get it.
Experimental drugs have been tried on six people: three Westerners and now, three African doctors.
One of the Westerners, a Catholic priest who was working in Liberia, has died. Reports say the other five are improving. It's still not known if the drug has helped.
The drug they received is Zmapp. The company says all the available supplies are already exhausted.
There are also about 1,000 doses of an experimental vaccine available, which may be used in West Africa. Neither of these treatments has been tested on human beings.
The World Health Organization decided that the desperate situation justifies the use of experimental drugs.
Dr. Robert Klitzman from Columbia University addressed some of the ethical issues in a Skype interview.
"Does it work? What should we tell people? What if it makes people worse? We want to make sure people understand that there are risks involved. If we have a limited supply, we need to decide who should get the vaccine or medication and who should not," said Klitzman.
Klitzman says in some sub-Saharan African languages, there's a word for "cure," but nothing that translates the word "experimental." He says anyone who receives an experimental drug has to be told it might not cure them, and if it might make the situation worse.
Dr. Chandrakant Ruparelia an infectious disease expert at Jhpiego, an organization that trains health care workers in Liberia. He says even if there were a large supply of these treatments, an untested drug has to be monitored.
“That’s an experimental medication still. It cannot be used on a large scale for every patient," said Ruparelia.
Klitzman agrees.
"We need to give it in a controlled way where we can see who got it, what happened, does it work, does it make them worse?," he said.
Other vaccines and treatments are being developed, but are not likely to be used to treat Ebola patients, even in an experimental form, at least not for this unprecedented outbreak.

Guinea Declares Public Health Emergency Over Ebola
Guinea has declared a public health emergency over the Ebola epidemic and is sending health workers to all affected border points, a government official said.
An estimated 377 people have died in Guinea since the world's worst outbreak of Ebola began in March in remote parts of a border region next to Sierra Leone and Liberia.
Guinea said its outbreak is under control with the number of new cases falling, but that the new measures are needed to prevent further infection from the other countries at the center of the epidemic.
“Trucks full of health materials and carrying health personnel are going to all the border points with Liberia and Sierra Leone,” Aboubacar Sidiki DiakitDe, president of Guinea's Ebola commission, said late Wednesday.
As many as 3,000 people are waiting at 17 border points for a green light to enter the country, he said.
Sierra Leone has declared Ebola a national emergency as has Liberia, which is hoping that two of its doctors diagnosed with Ebola can start treatment on Thursday with some of the limited supply of experimental drug ZMapp.
Nigeria confirms 11 cases
Nigeria has confirmed 11 cases of Ebola, after a doctor who treated the Liberian man who brought the disease to Lagos fell ill, the health minister said on Thursday.
The doctor had been involved in the initial treatment of Patrick Sawyer, who collapsed at Lagos airport on July 20, Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu told a news conference in the capital, Abuja.
A staff member of the West African regional economic body ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) this week became the third person in Nigeria to die of the disease.
“Eight (others) are still alive, more than half of them are doing very well and actually showing signs of recovery ... under treatment,” Chukwu said.
US Embassy
The United States said on Thursday it has ordered family members at the U.S. Embassy in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to depart because of limitations on regular medical care as a result of the Ebola outbreak.
“The Embassy recommended this step out of an abundance of caution, following the determination by the Department's Medical Office that there is a lack of options for routine health care services at major medical facilities due to the Ebola outbreak,” the State Department said in a statement.
The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama, in separate calls, spoke on Thursday with Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Sierra Leone President Ernest Koroma about the Ebola outbreak.
"In his conversations with both leaders, the president underscored the commitment of the United States to work with Liberia, Sierra Leone, and other international partners to contain the outbreak and expressed his condolences for the lives lost," the White House said.
In its latest update, released Wednesday, the World Health Organization said 1,069 people have died of Ebola this year in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The region's total number of cases stands at just under 2,000.
In addition, 170 health care workers have been infected with Ebola and at least 81 have died among the overall toll of 1,069 people dead, according to WHO.
WHO has called this Ebola outbreak an international emergency. It has killed between 55 to 60 percent of those who have contracted the disease.
There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola. On Tuesday, a WHO panel of medical experts said it is ethical to give patients unproven drugs to try to fight the disease.
Summit expands, airline service contracts
The outbreak has prompted the African Union to expand a summit in Burkina Faso next month so leaders can address the issue.
And on Thursday, another airline suspended flights to Africa. Korean Air Lines announced it will temporarily stop flights to and from Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in what it called a measure to contain Ebola.
No Ebola cases have been reported in Kenya, but WHO has classified the East African country as a high-risk area for the disease because of its role as a major transport hub.
Earlier, British Airways and the Middle Eastern airline Emirates suspended service to parts of West Africa in response to the outbreak.
Nurse breaks quarantine
A nurse with Ebola, which she caught from Sawyer, skipped quarantine in Lagos and headed to her home in the southeastern city of Enugu, where she was suspected to have had contact with 20 other people.
However, Chukwu said after initial screening, they realized only six people had been in contact with her, and they put those six under surveillance.
A total of 169 people were under surveillance in Lagos, after eight others were cleared, including all of Sawyer's primary contacts from when he came in.
The government also announced that Dangote Group, owned by Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote, had donated $150 million to halt the spread of the virus.

Liberians Living in US Struggle From Afar as Ebola Ravages Homeland
The more than 8,000 Liberians in New York City – the largest concentration outside Liberia itself – struggle from afar as the Ebola virus ravages their homeland.
Most Liberian immigrants to America live in the community known as Clifton, in the New York City borough of Staten Island.
Among the immigrants, the No. 1 topic of discussion is the Ebola virus, said the Reverend Philip Saywrayne.
“There has been discussions as to what engineered this Ebola. Others said that the Ebola was introduced by an animal from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The inhabitants of that land used the animal for food and there the Ebola virus derived from,” said Saywrayne, with the Christ Assembly Lutheran Church.
No cases
Local health officials said no one in this community has been infected with the virus.
However, the local market, which carries foods imported from Western Africa, is suffering.
Sellers at the market are seeing fewer customers, who may be worried about how the food was handled in Africa.
Bobby Digi, a community organizer with the Island Voice organization, also worries about a backlash against the Liberian-American community.
“They are very concerned that now because you’ve had the gentleman Duncan who has now passed, who is now deceased that the nation does not look at Liberians as all 'wow, we have to look out for Liberians.' It’s already happening, subliminally already,” Digi said.
The Reverend James Bestman, who directs the community's Liberian Cultural Association, said he talks to people in Liberia daily.
“They are dying. They want to get out of there. They want to leave Liberia,” Bestman said.
“It’s not safe for them at all. It’s critical, everywhere it’s critical. The young people, the babies … some people have whole families wiped out. In some areas the next door neighbor has lost their whole family and the other people want to move,” he said. “And, if they move, they have to go to another place which not even safe. So, it’s very tough for Liberia."
Preparations
At a news conference in New York’s City Hall, Mayor Bill de Blasio called the virus a “painful crisis” for the world.
“This is a painful time. It is also a time that the whole international community is recognizing that this is all of our problem,” de Blasio said. “This is something that has to be addressed by action, by countries all over the world to help address the problem at its core in West Africa.”
De Blasio said last week that the city has taken precautions. Authorities with various agencies, such as the Health Department, the Office of Emergency Management and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have discussed measures for any possible contingency.

With Flying Cars, Robot Petting Zoo, It's South by Southwest Time
Flying cars and a robot petting zoo. Mobile wallets and net neutrality. The most outlandish ideas of the future and tech trends shaping the world today will be in focus as the freewheeling South by Southwest Interactive Festival kicks off Thursday.
The annual Austin, Texas gathering has a looser reputation than bigger tech conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, even as it has become more corporate in recent years. It's a place where a Grumpy Cat appearance can generate as much excitement as the latest tech gizmo. It brought Twitter prominence in 2007 and location-sharing app Foursquare in 2009, but has since moved beyond the latest "killer app."
Last year, cybersecurity took center stage as NSA leaker Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange headlined the lineup of panels and speakers.
This year top speakers will tackle how to bring ideas that might seem like science fiction to the real world. Google's Astro Teller, who heads the tech giant's X division, will discuss making some of Google's most ambitious projects, like self-driving cars or balloon-powered Internet, a reality.
United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt will talk about tech innovations intersecting with artificial intelligence, immorality and the future of self.
The Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, will be on hand to discuss what Bitcoin needs to do to succeed as a mainstream currency. And former vice president Al Gore will make his third appearance at the annual festival to plug for new global climate legislation that is up for a vote in December.
But aside from the big-name keynotes, festival director Hugh Forrest says the heart of the conference is the smaller panels and competitions.
"We're excited about the very strong speakers we have, but the heart of the event is really the up-and -coming people we haven't heard of yet, people we'll hear of in the next few years," Forrest said. "South by Southwest is always about up-and-coming talent, be it a band or filmmaker or technology developer, and that holds true in 2015."
About 33,000-plus attendees from 82 countries are expected to flood into Austin to attend panels, network and party.
Jack Krawczyk, director of product management for music streaming site Pandora, said the festival is an ideal place to connect with Pandora clients and others in the tech sphere, particularly because of its focus on both music and technology. The company has had a presence at SXSW since it launched in 2005 and hosts a "Discovery Den" with performances by 35 artists during the festival.
"It's a great place to get a lot of like-minded folks in the industry together to think about how interactive media is evolving and shifting,'' Krawczyk said.
Here are a few trends to watch.
Wired Celebrities
Actress Jessica Alba on Monday will discuss how she has grown The Honest Co., which makes and sells environmentally friendly household and baby products online, into a $1 billion company. Actor Russell Brand, whose documentary "Brand: A Second Coming'' opens the film section of SXSW, will talk Tuesday about his new daily YouTube show Trews and the power of online media. Also Tuesday, retired news anchor Dan Rather address breaking news in the era of Snapchat.
Tech Meets the Real World
The nonprofit Field Innovation Team is hosting a "Robot Petting Zoo" Sunday through Tuesday to showcase new robots that have helped or are being developed to aid in disaster and humanitarian crisis spots, such as a drone that can 3-D print in midair. Attendees will be able to interact with the robots and learn about what they do.
Meanwhile, government agency USAID is debuting a prototype of a new Ebola-fighting suit for healthcare workers that is faster and more efficient than the current suit.
The Internet of things will be a hot topic as well. The Connected Car Council is hosting a pavilion on Saturday where automakers including Ford, Chrysler and Hyundai will showcase new technology. And Slovakian company Aeromobil, will detail its mission to create a flying car.
On Screen
The film festival at SXSW has several tech-related movies debuting, including Alex Gibney's documentary "Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine" which examines the Apple co-founder's legacy, and the documentary "Deep Web," which chronicles the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht, the founder of online black market Silk Road.
Carpool Wars
With limited public transportation and spread out hotels and venues, pedicabs have often been the easiest way to get around in prior years. Ride-hailing companies hope to change that. The festival's official ride-hailing company is Lyft, which will have designated pickup and dropoff zones around Austin's convention center.
Lyft will also be offering Lyft Line, its carpooling service, in Austin. But it will have competition. Uber will be offering its uberPool car-sharing service in the city as well, plus a promotion where some drivers may have VIP tickets to some SXSW events.

WHO: Ebola Is Still a Risk, Requires Vigilance
GENEVA —
Health ministers and officials at the World Health Organization's decision-making body are urging continued vigilance until the Ebola epidemic is completely stopped in West Africa. The World Health Assembly has called on the international community to maintain its commitment to defeating the deadly virus, which has killed more than 11,000 people in the region.
At a WHA conference here, Magaret Chan, WHO’s director-general, kicked off a panel discussion on Ebola with a cheery note – a reminder that Liberia had been declared Ebola-free May 9.
"Keep up with the good work, Liberia," she said.
But, Chan added, "this is a qualified victory … because the country remains at risk of reinfection from its neighbors."
The WHO’s latest report shows Sierra Leone and Guinea had 35 new cases of Ebola last week – four times higher than the week before.
The implied threat in this message was not lost on Miatta Gbanya, a senior official in Liberia’s Ministry of Health.
"When a disease hits your neighbor’s front door, beware that it could come to your back door," Gbanya said. “So, we have embarked on cross-border collaboration with Guinea and Sierra Leone … because countries need to start to talk to each other. We need to start to share information. We need to share knowledge and skills.”
Health ministers from all three West African countries agreed they need continued vigilance, increased surveillance and strong political will to bring Ebola cases down to zero.
They also spoke about the need to intimately involve communities in every aspect of an ongoing emergency or potential health emergency.
The ministers said they learned how important it is to win public acceptance of measures to control the Ebola virus or any public health threat. They noted that resistance to altering burial practices to prevent transmission of the virus prolonged the outbreak by many months
WHO plans reforms
Some participants said WHO must be restructured to respond more quickly to health emergencies.
"What I am fishing for is an effective organization inside the organization, which is empowered to actually have a look at all the hazards," said Claus Sorensen, director-general of the European Commission’s humanitarian aid department, known as ECHO.
That internal organization should be able to provide advance warning and to effectively support “the clusters in all the different humanitarian catastrophe situations that unfortunately are facing us around the world,” he said.
Sorensen observed that one emergency leads to another, so a health emergency will likely lead to a breakdown of food market systems, water and sanitation and protection services. The WHO should have the capacity to oversee and help coordinate solutions to these problems as well, he said.
The WHO has been criticized for its slow response to the crisis in West Africa.
In an address Monday to the assembly, Chan announced "some fundamental changes" so the WHO can better "lead the response to outbreaks and other health emergencies."
She laid out five changes, including:
Having a unified WHO program for health emergencies, with its leaders reporting directly to the director-general;
Establishing a global health emergency work force, with improved core and surge capacity;
Establishing a $100 million contingency fund, financed by member states’ voluntary contributions;
Developing business procedures that ensure a rapid, effective response;
Setting clear metrics for performance.
"I do not ever again want to see this organization faced with a situation it is not prepared, staffed, funded or administratively set up to manage," Chan said, adding she expected the changes would be completed by year’s end.

Obama: ‘Push Forward’ in Fight Against Ebola
U.S. President Barack Obama says the fight against Ebola remains challenging, with cases increasing in Sierra Leone and a doctor contracting the disease there before dying in the United States on Monday.
The president spoke Tuesday at the White House after a briefing with his Ebola response team. He said the continued outbreak in West Africa makes clear why a sustained fight against the disease is vital.
"It underscores how important it is to continue to push forward until we stamp out this disease entirely in that region," Obama said.
Obama opened his remarks about Ebola by expressing sorrow over the death of Dr. Martin Salia, a Sierra Leone citizen and U.S. legal resident who on Saturday arrived for treatment at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Already in critical condition, Salia died Monday.
He became the country’s second person to die of Ebola. The first, Thomas Eric Duncan, died at a Texas hospital in early October after contracting the disease in his native Liberia.
Treatment in the United States generally has a better outcome, Obama noted.
"… We’ve established that when Ebola is promptly diagnosed and treated, then we have a great chance of curing it," he said. Of eight patients treated promptly in the United States, all have recovered.
But until the outbreak is ended in West Africa, Obama said, there is still "some measure of risk" to people around the world.
The World Health Organization Friday reported a slight rise in the Ebola death toll, with 5,177 deaths among 14,413 confirmed cases worldwide. It said there has been a "steep increase" in the number of cases in Sierra Leone, including 421 new infections reported last week.
Congressional members solicit information
Members of the U.S. Congress are examining how to help West Africa’s struggle to cope with the outbreak, including with medical needs, logistics and disease education.
An official for the nonprofit International Medical Corps called for a response extending beyond the immediate crisis. Rabih Torbay, testifying at a Tuesday morning hearing held by the House subcommittee on Africa and global health, also recommended investment in emergency preparedness to head off future outbreaks.
Torbay said West Africa’s basic health services need to be strengthened overall – to fight not only Ebola but also malaria and other diseases and to improve childbirth safety and outcomes.
Darius Mans, president of the nongovernmental organization Africare, urged establishing better health care and preparedness systems in the affected areas. He said Africare has begun converting some of its training facilities to treat not just Ebola but all infectious diseases once the current crisis is over.
Later Tuesday, another congressional committee was to hear from several experts about U.S. response to the Ebola crisis. Testimony was expected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s director, Thomas Frieden, plus acting Surgeon General Boris Lushniak and Texas state health commissioner David Lakey.

Experts: More Education Needed to Contain Ebola
DAKAR, SENEGAL —
The Ebola outbreak has killed nearly 900 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and now Nigeria. This is the first time West Africa has seen Ebola, and it is turning out to be the worst outbreak of the disease ever, in part because people either don't what to or are refusing to comply with public health recommendations. Experts say education may be more effective than enforcement.
More of education is what public health experts say may turn the tide against Ebola.
Health worker Bunch Wieh met with a community in Margibi county, Liberia. Two people have died of the disease here.
"Ebola has no cure. Ebola has no cure. But what you can do is to prevent yourself from the deadly disease. Please stop eating bush meat. Please stop touching your friend. Please stop shaking hands. These are ways people can catch the Ebola disease," said Wieh.
People have plenty of questions.
A man asked, "if there's no cure, then what can doctors do for people at the hospital? What's the point of going there?"
It's a common area of confusion. Health workers continue to remind people that some patients are fighting off the disease with medical care.
They emphasize that for containment to work, sick people must be isolated so they don't infect others - and that every person who had contact with an Ebola patient's bodily fluids must be monitored, in case any of those people get sick.
That is how you stop the chain of infection.
But that isn't happening everywhere in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak.
The virus spread quickly across those countries' borders starting earlier this year. People did not know what the disease was. Some infected people hid from authorities or ran away. Families continued to handle and bury the bodies of Ebola victims. And so, the disease continued to spread.
Stephane Doyon, the West African chief for Doctors without Borders, said that communities continued to resist medical assistance and more education is needed.
"In Liberia, Sierra Leone and certain parts of Guinea where we are having trouble accessing certain villages. We know there are probably cases there, that people are dying and that the disease is spreading. But we can do nothing. We either don't know about the cases, or the population won't let us in because they don't understand we are there to help," said Doyon.
Liberia and Sierra Leone have deployed security forces to enforce containment measures and protect health workers amid growing hostility. It's illegal to knowingly harbor someone who has Ebola. Liberia is considering quarantining affected zones. Sierra Leone already has.
But can the outbreak be stopped through such dramatic measures?
Dr. Unni Krishnan, the head of disaster response and prevention for Plan International.
"These measures will have limitations so this is where informing people, educating people, and encouraging them to come forward is key. That's what will finally be yielding results," said Dr. Krishnan.
He said more international funds were needed for nearly every aspect of this response effort, especially education.
Meanwhile, health volunteers continue going door-to-door. They are handing out leaflets and tying up signs with hand drawn pictures of the various symptoms and putting catchy songs on the radio, scrambling to get to people before Ebola does.

US Disease Detectives Pursuing Ebola’s Trail
CONAKRY, GUINEA —
A year into an Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 8,000 people in West Africa, resistance still plagues the public health response.
And when a public servant charged with protecting people denies the deadly virus’ existence, it’s especially alarming, said Meredith Dixon, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She was visiting one of Guinea’s western prefectures when a police officer stopped the vehicle in which she was riding. Dixon and her driver explained they’d been traveling for Ebola research.
"The gendarme said, 'There’s no such thing as Ebola,'" Dixon said. "I know, I know – there are people who don’t believe. But to hear it is a little different."
That resistance both challenges and motivates Dixon and other Americans involved in the international effort to combat Ebola. They’re helping local governments – in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and some neighboring countries – as they try to track, treat and prevent the unpredictable disease.
While dismissiveness gradually has been yielding to rising death tolls and aggressive public awareness campaigns, other obstacles remain. Among them: a general mistrust of outsiders, particularly white people; limited formal education; and poor infrastructure, especially a rickety health care system devastated by years of civil strife and widespread poverty.
Dixon, 36, is among more than 170 CDC staff members in West Africa aiming to expand knowledge about Ebola and how to fight it. Most rotate in for one or two months. Dixon is wrapping up a three-month tour, by far the longest of three trips she’s made to Guinea since the country’s health ministry acknowledged the Ebola outbreak. She was one of the early responders, arriving in April for a month and returning in July for another.
A pediatrician, Dixon has been drawn to West Africa since volunteering with the Peace Corps in Cameroon and Gabon. Now, as an officer training in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, she appreciates working among the region’s "kind" and "fantastic" people, polishing her skills in disease detection.
She focuses on health workers and their infection control practices, putting in countless hours in urban field hospitals and remote villages, working with Guinean and international teams, interviewing and encouraging.
Dixon recalled speaking with an infected doctor at an Ebola treatment center. When another patient arrived, moaning from abdominal pain, the doctor turned to offer a few calming words. Despite his illness, "he was still in a role as a physician, providing support to others," she said. "It was a very touching moment for me. … This conversation was one which really made me feel the immensity of this work."
But as the outbreak has dragged on, even some health workers have become complacent or careless. "We have seen, in parts of all three of the countries, health care workers relaxing their grip on the response, not using protective equipment, not thinking of Ebola at every opportunity," CDC Director Tom Frieden said recently.
Still, health experts say they see progress. The transmission rate has slowed in Liberia and even in Sierra Leone, where it has been most intense, though it has fluctuated in Guinea since September. But experts have learned to be wary, especially after missing key cases last spring and mistakenly believing the outbreak was winding down. The World Health Organization, too, has been faulted for delaying the international call to arms and inadequately coordinating aid.
There’s yet another challenge: weariness among West Africans and others working with them to battle Ebola.
"I’m very tired, just like everybody else," said Dixon, who puts in long hours six and sometimes seven days a week. "But we have to keep doing what we’re doing, and doing it better."
Connecting cases
The Ebola virus slips in quietly, going underground as it lays waste to cells, to organs, to lives.
The only way to stop its spread is to find everyone who’s come in contact with an infected person, then monitor them daily for 21 days – the disease’s maximum incubation period. Any sign of fever, nausea, diarrhea or other symptoms should prompt isolation and treatment.
Identifying contacts is a specialty of disease detectives like Dixon and John Ngulefac, another CDC epidemiologist involved in training local teams. Once a police detective in his native Cameroon, he transferred his sleuthing talents to the public health agency. His knowledge of French and West African languages and customs, plus a cool, commanding presence, help elicit information.
CDC epidemiologist John Ngulefac visits a community health center in Conakry, Guinea, while seeking clues about Ebola's spread.
Ngulefac, a handful of other CDC investigators, and a community agent followed the killer virus’ trail one autumn morning in this capital city to a walled compound where a person had recently died.
Inside, a slender girl stepped away from several young children playing in the dirt courtyard. Keeping a few meters’ distance from the visitors, she introduced herself as Aminata. The 16-year-old was named for her maternal grandmother, who came to the household with the first signs of her mortal illness.
The younger Aminata told Ngulefac she had helped care for the ailing woman, scrubbing her soiled clothing and bedding. She didn’t wear rubber gloves or other protective gear – risky because the virus is transmitted through direct contact with a sick person’s bodily fluids – but to date hadn’t shown any sign of illness. Nor had anyone else in the household.
Ngulefac posed more questions.
Did Aminata know the cause of her grandmother’s death? Yes, she said, Ebola.
Had that knowledge affected her behavior with friends? She shrugged and shook her head vigorously.
How did she greet her friends? Aminata clasped her hands to demonstrate a handshake. Investigators exchanged uneasy glances; touching has been discouraged during the outbreak.
A worker scrubs uniforms and other items at the Doctors Without Borders Ebola treatment center in Conakry, Guinea.
The teen also established that her grandmother was the sister of an imam, a Muslim leader who’d died earlier of Ebola. That tip – later pooled with information from a local clinic and the nearby Ebola treatment center run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders – turned up more connections in the transmission chains.
"That was contract tracing like you want," investigator Jon Eric Tongren said later.
Troubling time frame
Later that day, CDC investigators learned the Doctors Without Borders center had admitted seven new patients. Five had been on their contact tracing list.
Ngulefac was troubled that it had taken 18 days of monitoring; community agents may have overlooked something.
"They should not only be taking temperatures, they need to interview in depth. Maybe they weren’t asking the pertinent question," said Ngulefac, who has urged more training – not only for the agents but for health care workers.
Community agents, such as these two visiting a health center in Conakry, Guinea, play a vital role in tracing Ebola contacts and monitoring their health.
But Ngulefac and his teammates said they also were impressed by community agents’ determination and personal sacrifice. Agents fan out daily, sometimes starting at 5 in the morning and returning long after dark as they pursue leads and check in with contacts.
The WHO and other entities supply agents with bikes or motorcycles – but not necessarily the money for fuel, the investigators said they were told.
"Most of these individuals are using their personal resources," Ngulefac said, adding that they’re paid only a pittance. "What we need now is support for them."
Coming up with solutions
Finding solutions is part of the detectives’ work, too. Tongren said he’d proposed performance-based financing – an incentive model used in campaigns to eradicate polio and other communicable diseases – to increase tracing agents’ wages and cover their fuel costs.
The plan also would create incentives for broader cooperation in contact tracing, Tongren said. For instance, it would provide a finder’s fee for identifying an individual who might have been exposed to or infected by the virus. It also would compensate people held in quarantine.
While there was no word on finder’s fees, in December Guinea’s health minister, Remy Lamah, told VOA his government was "working with its partners to provide [quarantined] families of contacts with food and money assistance."
And transportation problems have eased among all three Ebola-affected countries. The nonprofit CDC Foundation, which supports partnerships to help the agency’s work, by mid-December had bought 206 four-wheel-drive vehicles and more than 400 motorcycles for West African health teams. The vehicles can be used for contact tracing or for transporting patients, corpses or specimens. The foundation partnered with another organization, eHealth Africa, to provide fuel, insurance and maintenance.
The CDC is "helpful by providing all the necessary logistical assistance so that we can reach our goal for the well-being of the population," Lamah said, praising "its expertise" in contact tracing and monitoring.
Making a difference
The Centre de Sante de Macire, a community health center, characterizes the neediness of West African health care systems. Even here in Guinea’s capital, the 10-room center lacks running water and reliable electricity – though a small generator powers the refrigerator holding temperature-sensitive medications. Mosquito netting is bundled over the two patient beds in a small room with open windows and peeling yellow paint.
In the delivery room, babies often arrive by candlelight or flashlight. The center’s director, Mohamed Oulare, said the clinic handled as many as 60 deliveries a month before the outbreak.
Though "no case of Ebola has passed through," as Oulare insisted in late September, fear of contracting the virus had kept away many laboring women and other patients – threatening their health and that of the pay-as-you-go center.
Drawn to country
That neediness – along with a desire to make a difference and a love for the region – has drawn epidemiologist Dixon to Guinea again and again.
CDC epidemiologist Meredith Dixon finds a sense of purpose doing Ebola research in Guinea.
"It’s tiring, but I’m learning a ton. … This is public-health gold – it’s such a rich learning environment," said Dixon, who’s "learning about the disease, about working with foreign governments and other international partners."
But "working with the [Guinean] people here is a big reason I’ve come back."
She’s had plenty of opportunity to hone the surveillance and interviewing skills needed to coax out information. And she’s discovered that even health care workers, who normally appreciate the need for detailed medical charts, are reticent as patients.
"It’s like this with patients in general: A story doesn’t quite make sense, so you ask multiple questions," Dixon said. "At the beginning, they don’t want to tell you. There’s definitely a lot of stigma that prevents stories from being told."
In one case, teammates following up on a sick health worker told Dixon they’d interviewed the man’s friend. "I asked if there were any random deaths in that village. ‘No, no, no,' " she said they told her.
But a review of the nearest Ebola treatment center’s patient registry showed otherwise. Dixon saw a pattern, so she asked the team to return to the village to get more details. "Digging deeper and [demonstrating] persistence are the keys here," she said. "… You just have to keep at it."
Dixon said the experience prepares her, and her government, to address future public health threats – whether outbreaks of Ebola or other infectious diseases.
She’ll welcome a break from so much sickness and loss of life, she said. She’s heading back to the United States this month and expects to complete her epidemiologic training in June.
She’s already trying to figure out how she’ll make her way back to West Africa.

Liberia Urges Ebola Survivors to Abstain from Sex Beyond Recommended Period
Liberian authorities are urging Ebola survivors to refrain from unprotected sex beyond the recommended 90 days, after the country's first Ebola death in more than a month.
The female patient who died Friday was married to a man who had the disease but survived.
Officials fear she may have gotten sick through sexual transmission.
The World Heath Organization recommends that Ebola survivors refrain from sex for 90 days. But Liberian officials urge former patents to at least use condoms beyond that time, until more information is known.
Liberia had been hit hardest by the Ebola epidemic. The 44-year-old woman was its first confirmed case in more than a month.

WHO Expects Liberia's Ebola Caseload Will Surge
The Ebola virus is spreading exponentially in Liberia, the World Health Organization said, predicting thousands of new cases there in the coming weeks.
The agency said Monday the number of new Liberian cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them.
Liberia already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths of Ebola in West Africa. The disease has killed more than 2,000 people, spreading from Guinea to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal.
The WHO said that, with few free beds for treating Ebola patients in Liberia, some infected people are traveling across the capital in search of a treatment center.
In another development Monday, the United States and Britain said they plan to send military personnel and equipment to West Africa to help set up new treatment centers.
The Pentagon said military personnel will set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, for infected health care workers. Britain's military said it will open a 62-bed treatment facility in Sierra Leone, near the capital, Freetown.
Also Monday, hospital officials in the southern U.S. city of Atlanta say a fourth American who contracted Ebola in West Africa is expected to arrive in the Untied States Tuesday to receive care.
The patient, who was not named, will arrive by air ambulance at Emory University Hospital, where two other aid workers successfully recovered from the disease. A third patient, a U.S. doctor, is being treated in a Nebraska hospital, where on Monday his family said he was able to eat breakfast for the first time since falling sick.
U.S. calls for international response
On Sunday, President Barack Obama called for the international community to help combat the Ebola crisis in West Africa, where he said a lack of public health infrastructure has led to the spread of a "containable problem."
Obama told NBC News that U.S. military assets are needed to set up isolation units and equipment and to provide security for international health workers.
"If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates, it becomes more easily transmittable," the president said.
Dealing with the Ebola outbreak should be a national security priority for the United States, the president said.
The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Liberia would welcome U.S. aid
Liberian Defense Minister Brownie Samukai told VOA his country looks forward to any U.S. assistance, saying that Liberia's economy is "at a standstill" and that it is challenging for the country to provide its citizens basic health care.
He approved of setting up field hospitals to treat any health care workers who might get infected in the line of duty. "At least they would have a place to go to be easily treated," the defense minister said.
African Union officials held an emergency meeting Monday in Addis Ababa to discuss how to respond. It included discussion of the effects of closing borders and suspending flights to the affected countries.
AU chairman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma stressed the need for public health education and efforts that do not "fuel stigmatization and isolation."
Experimental vaccine shows promise
Meanwhile, new studies indicate an experimental Ebola vaccine, which is being tested on monkeys, can work for five weeks or up to 10 months if used in conjunction with a booster shot.
In a study published Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) say the experimental vaccine regimen produced durable immunity against the deadly virus.
Researchers say a single dose of the vaccine protected all four test monkeys when exposed to Ebola five weeks later. They said half were protected when exposed to the virus 10 months after vaccination.
However, in tests on a separate group of monkeys, scientists say a booster shot, given two months after the initial vaccination, extended protection for all vaccinated monkeys for up to 10 months.
The vaccine tested by the NIH is similar to one being developed by drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.

Ebola-Ravaged Guinea Overcomes Odds to Reach Nations Cup
JOHANNESBURG —
Ebola-ravaged Guinea overcame considerable odds to book an African Nations Cup finals place, but must still deal with logistical difficulties and prejudice as they look ahead to the tournament in January.
Guinea is one of the African countries hit hardest by the ravages of the deadly haemorrhagic fever, which has claimed more than 1,100 lives there.
Their national team have had to play homes games at a neutral venue after the Confederation of African Football banned the hosting of international matches in Guinea.
Their players have also come under pressure to avoid the competition.
Borussia Moenchengladbach's Ibrahima Traore, who scored for Guinea in their decisive tie against Uganda on Wednesday to secure qualification, was threatened with isolation from his Bundesliga team mates when he returned.
“We have had to go around in a very strange context,” coach Michel Dussuyer said this week, “with health checks and fleeting glances.”
Morocco allowed them to play their 'home' games in Casablanca, but the players had to undergo temperature checks twice daily.
“There have been some measures we've felt have been discriminatory and when you have your temperature taken twice a day it can get annoying. But everything really is in the attitude of people you meet and the strange responses we get,” Dussuyer added.
The coach has stayed in Guinea's capital Conakry even though almost all of his players fly in and out of Africa from their clubs in Europe.
“We ourselves have been very attentive to what is happening within the squad. We are not irresponsible. We are prudent, it's a logical approach and it is accepted,” Dussuyer said.
The coach, however, also thanked Morocco, who allowed them to play their qualifiers in Casablanca, and Benin, where they held training camps.
Guinea now need to find a training venue for two weeks in January, before the Nations Cup kicks off.
“There is great satisfaction in being able to qualify and to silence our detractors,” Dussuyer added, after Guinea finished second in their group behind Ghana.

The U.S. military says it is scaling back its planned Ebola response deployments to West Africa from 4,000 troops to 3,000.
Major General Gary Volesky, who heads the U.S. military's response to the Ebola outbreak, said in a call to reporters at the Pentagon from Liberia the United States does not need 4,000 troops to fight Ebola in West Africa. He said the troop total will increase from about 2,200 today to just under 3,000 by mid-December.
"There is a lot of capacity here that we did not know about before, and so that enabled us to reduce the forces that we thought we originally had to bring," said Volesky.
Volesky said the United States had about 2,200 U.S. troops currently in Liberia, a number that would grow to nearly 3,000 next month. The mission was initially authorized for up to 4,000.
"We will top out in the middle of December just short of 3,000, and that's the most we'll bring into country," he said.
The U.S. military deployed forces to Liberia to support the international Ebola response mission led by the U.S. Agency for International Development. U.S. troops were assigned to build up to 17 Ebola treatment units and provide mobile testing labs.
"When the original request for forces was created, it was larger than that, but what we found ... is there's a lot of capacity here that we didn't know about before," Volesky said. "That enabled us to reduce the forces that we thought we originally had to bring."
The general says the approximately 3,000-troop team will remain heavy on engineers, medical providers and trainers.
U.S. Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac says the rate of increase in Ebola cases is much lower than it has been over the past couple of months. But she warned more still needs to be done.
"The numbers of cases continue to increase. We are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination," said Malac.
The ambassador told reporters Liberia needs more treatment units and more personnel to help treat Ebola patients.
The World Health Organization has reported about 14,000 cases of Ebola since the outbreak began. The organization announced Wednesday the number of people who have died from the virus now has passed 5,000.
Some material for this report came from Reuters.

WHO Calls for Coordinated Response to Fight Ebola
The United Nations World Health Organization is calling for a coordinated global response to combat the growing Ebola outbreak affecting parts of West Africa.
Margaret Chan, director-general of the global health body, Wednesday said the outbreak has so far killed more than 1,900 people and infected at least 3,500 in the region.
"It has become a global threat and we require urgent action and we need a well-coordinated mechanism bringing together the countries affected, as well as development partners from other countries, including USA," she said. "Now that I am in U.S., I want to tell you, the U.S. government has been a very strong supporter through many agencies like the CDC, NIH, and of course USAID and others."
The WHO estimates that it will cost upwards of $600 million to tackle the epidemic.
The health organization has introduced a plan it calls a "roadmap" for stopping the spread of Ebola.
Chan said the proposed roadmap has wide support from countries and institutions throughout Africa, and that many developed countries have responded as well.
"Ebola is an international issue, a global threat that requires global coordination to get it done,” said Chan.
Chan also said scientists at WHO headquarters in Geneva will evaluate the most promising experimental therapies that could be fast-tracked to help contain the outbreak.
David Navarro, the United Nations coordinator for Ebola, also spoke fo the need for coordination.
"Those of us who have worked in complex situations know that coordination saves lives and improves efficiency… We're not in a position where we can afford to lose a day because this outbreak is currently moving ahead of efforts to control it," said Navarro.
Tom Kenyon, director of the Center for Global Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the virus is "spiraling out of control" and that the window of opportunity to fight it is closing.
U.S. health officials say the key to containing the outbreak will be increasing the number of Ebola treatment centers, providing protective equipment for health workers and monitoring the contacts of those infected.
Experts have warned that Ebola could spread beyond the five West African countries that have been affected: Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
The World Health Organization says a separate, smaller outbreak in a remote part of the Democratic Republic of Congo is unrelated to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
"Democratic Republic of Congo, this outbreak is smaller, and at this point in time we have epidemiological evidence as well as viruses sequencing to demonstrate that this is an independent outbreak," Chan said. "It is important to highlight this point. It is not a spread from West Africa to central Africa, so that means we are seeing a much, much bigger outbreak, or people coined the term epidemic, in West Africa while at the same time DRC is reporting a smaller outbreak on its own."
Meanwhile, a British nurse infected with Ebola has been released from the hospital after recovering from the virus.
The Royal Free London Hospital said Wednesday that William Pooley's 10 days of treatment included the experimental drug ZMapp.
He was taken to the hospital last month after contracting Ebola while working in Sierra Leone.

African Leaders to Meet on Burkina Faso, Ebola Outbreak
Heads of state and government officials from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) plan to meet Thursday at an extraordinary summit in Ghana’s capital, Accra.
High on the agenda is discussing measures to ensure a peaceful transition and restoration of democratic rule in Burkina Faso, as well as reassessing efforts to contain the outbreak of Ebola in parts of West Africa, according to Haruna Warkani, a spokesman for ECOWAS.
“The two important things on the agenda are combating the outbreak of the Ebola, the containment, the efforts so far made, the successes and the challenges that are still outstanding, and then of course the unfortunate development in Burkina Faso,” said Warkani.
His comments came after an ECOWAS delegation comprising Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, Senegalese President Macky Sall and Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama, who also heads ECOWAS, met Wednesday with Burkina Faso’s designated military leader, Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Zida, and other stakeholders about the need to expedite a transition process.
Warkani said the regional bloc will continue its push to ensure a restoration of constitutional order in Burkina Faso.
“It is because of the importance attached to this development that’s why the heads of state could afford to carve out time within their very busy schedules to do that,” said Warkani. “So, surely, the regional body is doing everything possible to ensure that this crisis does not escalate, and that the constitutional authority is restored and that will pave way for developments in the country.”
Some analysts say there appears to be a divide between ECOWAS and the African Union about how best to ensure a smooth civilian transition in Burkina Faso after protesters forced longtime leader Blaise Compaore to step down and flee into exile.
They contend that while the African Union demanded in an ultimatum that the military leader Zida hand over power within two weeks to a civilian authority, a team of West African leaders that met with leaders in Burkina Faso said it could take up to a year before elections could be organized.
But Warkani said the two institutions are working together to resolve the political crisis in the West African country.
“It’s a matter of perception sometimes and of course the two bodies are working towards achieving success of the situation,” he said. “Don’t forget when things like this crop up, there are bound to be several dimensions to it, but the bottom line is that there should be restoration of peace, tranquility and constitutional transfer of power to an appropriate authority in that country. So, it’s not really a matter of contradiction.”

Doctor's Death Pushes Mali's Ebola Toll to Seven
A doctor in Mali has died of Ebola after treating an imam who succumbed to the disease, taking the Ebola death toll in the West African country up to seven.
The World Health Organization said the Ebola virus was "almost certainly reintroduced into Mali by a 70-year-old imam from Guinea." The cleric was admitted to a Bamako clinic October 25 and died two days later.
Health authorities in Mali say they are monitoring 338 people linked with the country's six other fatal Ebola cases. Most are under daily surveillance.
The World Health Organization said Thursday that all 118 people who had direct contact with the Ebola victims have completed their 21-day incubation period without developing symptoms.
In the United States, meanwhile, a traveler from Mali has tested negative for Ebola at a New York City hospital. The patient will remain isolated until more tests are conducted to confirm the results.
The WHO had updated its Ebola figures Wednesday, saying there were a total of 5,420 Ebola deaths among 15,145 cases in the 2014 outbreak. It cautioned, though, that the numbers of cases and deaths were continuing to be underreported.
There have been a handful of cases elsewhere in the world, including the United States, but the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone remain the epicenter of the epidemic.

Burkina Opposition, International Community Call for Army to Bow Out of Transition
DAKAR, OUAGADOUGOU —
Thousands of Burkinabe took to the streets again Sunday, in Ouagadougou, this time to protest the army, which the political opposition says is trying to hijack the people’s ousting of President Blaise Compaore. The military declared itself in charge Friday after four consecutive days of large and at times violent protests resulted in Compaore's resignation.
Some carried signs reading “Soldiers stole our revolution.”
One protester told VOA this wasn’t a coup so citizens don’t understand why the military thought they could choose the new head of state.
The opposition had called for the protest.
“The victory resulting from this people’s insurrection belongs to the people and as a result the leadership of the transition belongs to the people and should not be confiscated under any circumstances by the army,” Opposition member Jean Hubert Bazié said as he read the declaration late Saturday, adding that the the transition should be “democratic and civilian.”
Closed door meeting
Opposition leaders spent Sunday behind closed doors meeting with the country’s military leader, Lt. Col Yacouba Isaac Zida.
Outside, demonstrations gave way to more of the confusion that has characterized the crisis.
Soldiers took over the state television station and fired warning shots to disperse a large crowd Sunday afternoon.
Opposition politician Saran Sereme was inside. People in the crowd said she was going to declare herself president. But Sereme told reporters afterwards the crowd had pushed her there and she sought refuge inside. Sereme said she was not going to make a statement.
Zida in charge
After Compaore's resignation Friday, two military officers each made statements claiming to be in charge. On Saturday, the military named one of them, Lt. Col. Zida, as head of the transition.
Zida, the number two in the country’s elite presidential guard, has pledged to hold democratic elections “as soon as possible,” but has given no details.
He suspended the constitution, declared a nighttime curfew and shut the country’s borders.
The United Nations, African Union and the Economic Community of West African States have sent delegations to Burkina Faso.
U.N. special representative Mohamed Ibn Chambas called for dialogue and said Sunday “we hope for a transition led by a civilian and in line with the constitution." “If that is not done,” he said, “the consequences are clear.” He said they must “do all they can” to avoid sanctions and a suspension of Burkina Faso.
Analysis
In Washington, Dr. Sulayman Nyang, professor and chairman of the African Studies Department at Howard University, says events in Burkina Faso must be looked at in relation to developments in other parts of Africa.
“We have to go back over two years when the situation was unfolding in North Africa. What was called the Arab Spring must be translated as the political Harmattan wind from the North to the South. It took this long before the Harmattan hit West Africa,” Nyang said, adding that the Burkinabe youth are not taking action simply because they didn’t like President Compaore.
“They are fighting because they don’t want dictators that stay there and they create corruption, lack of transparency and bad governance,” Nyang explained. “They are not fighting for personality or military leaders, they are fighting for justice.”
Nyang says President Compaore was able to stay in power for 27 years for many reasons.
“Compaore was very close to Houphouet Boigny [in Ivory Coast], Charles Taylor [in Liberia], Fode Sanko [in Sierra Leone] and his ability to serve as a broker and a peacemaker between the contending forces legitimized his role.”
Constitution
The Constitution says the head of the National Assembly takes over in the president's absence. However, he has reportedly also fled the country and the army dissolved the National Assembly. In such a case, the Constitutional Court could name a new leader.
The international delegation said the regional Ebola epidemic makes it especially important for the country’s interim leadership to restore government administration and public services as soon as possible.
Burkina Faso has not had any confirmed cases of Ebola, but neighboring Mali declared its first case in October.

Liberians Mark 168 Years of Independence
Liberia celebrated 168 years of independence Sunday with mixed feelings about the state of progress in areas like the economy. In an informal survey conducted by the independent FrontPage Africa newspaper of Liberia, some Liberians said their country has regressed in the quality of education, health care, the fight against corruption, employment, and good governance.
Here in Washington, hundreds gathered Saturday at the Liberian Embassy to participate in an all-day cultural extravaganza to mark the occasion.
Ambassador Jeremiah Sulunteh said, although Liberia faces some difficult challenges, still people have reasons to celebrate their 168th independence anniversary.
“A year ago when Ebola struck Liberia and whole West African region, Liberians could not celebrate their independence the way we do today. Our hearts are broken for the lives lost, including 4,700, including 192 health care workers, who were helping trying save lives. But today, we thank God that we have the courage, the opportunity to celebrate another independence of our country,” he said.
At an Independence Day diplomatic reception on Friday, the ambassador honored and paid tribute to some of those who helped Liberia during the Ebola crisis, particularly health workers.
Doctors Samuel Brisbane, Abraham Borbor and Michel du Cille, who died while fighting the Ebola disease, were honored posthumously. Dr. John T. Wulu and the People’s Congregational United Church of Christ were also honored for giving material support to the fight against Ebola.
Sulunteh also thanked the international community, including the United States, for what he called their “robust and outstanding support.”
"We remember those who suffered; we remember those who died; we remember those who labored to get us where we are. Even as we do so, we appreciate the international community and our development partners, especially the United States, who came up with an outstanding, robust support, and [the] resilience of the Liberian people, together with the strong leadership of Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to get Liberia where it is today,” Sulunteh said.
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Bisa Williams said the longstanding special bond between Liberia and the United States will remain forever strong.
She said Liberia has overcome many challenges since independence and will continue to do so in the face of the Ebola epidemic. She promised continued U.S. support for Liberia and all of West Africa.
“We will remain fully engaged in a partnership with West Africa to build the capacity within the entire region to prevent, detect, and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. As Liberia’s unwavering partner, we will also remain committed to supporting Liberia’s development and post-Ebola recovery plan,” Williams said.
Olivia Shannon, former director of the Liberia Broadcasting System, who is visiting the United States, had a message for Liberian parents. She said they should teach their children well about the country of their birth.
“We have a lot to teach the population at home and abroad. There’s a little boy who came to the table where I am sitting that talks about education in Liberia. He saw the picture of little girls with [computer] tablets and he asked what do they know about tablet? That tells me in his home he has been told that the children in Liberia know nothing. So, my thinking is that the parents in America themselves have to be taught about Liberia and what is happening there so that they will give their kids the right information about their country,” Shannon said.
Former Liberian broadcaster Jerry Wion said he and other Liberians were thankful that there is no more war in Liberia. But, he said the government has failed to deliver on the development it promised Liberians 10 years ago.
“All is not well, the economy and the hardships of our people. But, we are thankful there is peace, there’s no more fighting except that this president (Sirleaf) has not delivered the promises she made to the Liberian people. It’s 10 years now, still no water and electricity,” Wion said.
Despite their misgivings, Liberians danced to the music of various Liberian artists as vendors sold all a variety of Liberian food, clothes and artifacts.

Obama Announces $33B Commitment at Africa Forum
President Barack Obama says the United States is making a major and long-term commitment in Africa with $33 billion in new investment.
Speaking Tuesday at the U.S.- Africa Business Forum in Washington, Obama said the new investment and financing commitments will support both African and American jobs. The bulk of the commitments will come from private sector companies like Coca-Cola and IBM.
Obama emphasized that the U.S. is interested in more than just the abundance of natural resources to be found in Africa. He noted that trade with Africa still represents a small fraction of overall U.S. commerce, adding that "we've got to do better, much better."
The three-day Africa summit concludes Wednesday.
Obama said the Power Africa program he announced last year will triple its previous commitment of bringing electricity to 20 million more African homes and businesses, and said it is raising the bar to bring good things to life for 60 million African people.
But he cautioned the roughly 50 African heads of state gathered at the summit that the future of Africa is to be found on the African continent, not in the United States.
The president said the U.S. will do more to help African nations trade with each other. He said it should not be harder to export goods to your neighbor than to export goods to Los Angeles or Amsterdam.
As the worst Ebola outbreak on record rages on in West Africa, Obama told African leaders that keeping their citizens healthy and putting a health care system in place will ensure their countries' future economic success.
s in the energy, banking, construction and information technology fields.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced an additional $10 million for a U.S. initiative to finance clean energy sources in Africa.
He said the U.S. wants to see millions of Africans gain access to power in their homes.
"More than 600 million Africans live without access to electricity today. And, our challenge is clear. We need to change those numbers and replace them with a partnership that benefits all sides by making sure that African companies, African cities, African towns, African families have access to clean and renewable energy," said Kerry.
The U.S.-African Leaders summit opened on Monday with forums touching on a range of issues, including regional security, health, the environment and corruption.
50 heads of state
It comes on the second day of a U.S.-Africa summit involving nearly 50 African heads of state.
​"These investments will deepen U.S. economic engagement in Africa, fueling growth that will support broader African prosperity and emerging markets for U.S. businesses, which will support jobs in both the United States and Africa,'' the White House official said.
Obama will take part in a discussion with corporate chief executives and government leaders at the event on Wednesday, which will be attended by Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and former President Bill Clinton.
The business forum will allow dozens of African heads of state to mingle with U.S. and African executives, the official said. It will focus broadly on investment in finance, infrastructure, energy, agriculture and consumer goods.
More than 90 U.S. companies are slated to participate including Chevron Corp., Citigroup Inc., Ford Motor Co., General Electric Co., IBM, Lockheed Martin Corp., Marriott International Inc., Morgan Stanley and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Several African companies were also expected to attend.
In a brief preview of Obama's remarks, the White House did not give specifics on the nature of the business deals or identify which companies were involved.
"These agreements represent conclusive evidence that America is open for more business with Africa as the continent's economic ascent is just beginning,'' Pritzker said in a statement.
"Each day, 250,000 Americans go to work in jobs supported by exports to Africa and these deals will lead to increased prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic in the months ahead,'' she said.
The Obama administration has billed the summit as the first of its kind, but it comes long after Africa gatherings hosted in recent years by China, India, Japan and Europe, suggesting the United States is largely playing a game of catch-up for access to a market in several growing industries.
Opening day
The U.S.-African Leaders summit opened on Monday with forums touching on a range of issues, including regional security, health, the environment and corruption.
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden speaking on Monday said the African continent has some of the world's fastest growing economies, and that those countries will help shape future developments in the world.
"We're on the cusp where the continent of Africa establishes itself as among the ranks of the world's most prosperous economic and free nations," Biden said.
"In your hands, with your help, Africa can and will go so much further. You're the fastest growing economies in the world, and quite frankly the success of the rest of the world depends in part on your success," he added.
Later Tuesday, Obama is hosting dinner at the White House for the African leaders.
The White House said singer Lionel Richie will entertain the leaders during the dinner on the South Lawn. For dinner, guests will dine on chilled spiced tomato soup, chopped farm-stand vegetable salad, grilled dry-aged beef and cappuccino fudge cake, according to The Associated Press.
The leaders of Sierra Leone and Liberia canceled their trips to Washington because of the Ebola epidemic facing their countries.

Texas: Up to 100 People Could Have Had Contact With Ebola Patient
Up to 100 people may have had direct or indirect contact with the first person to be diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus in the United States, and four of his relatives have been quarantined in their homes as a precaution, Texas health officials said Thursday.
Dallas County officials said 12 to 18 people had direct contact with the Texas patient,who has been identified as Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, and they in turn had contact with scores of others.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said most of the 100 people have been interviewed and the CDC has identified only a handful of individuals so far who may really have been exposed to Ebola and therefore will be monitored.
Erikka Neroes, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County health department, said none of those being monitored were showing symptoms of the disease, which include fever, uncontrollable bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea and spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva.
Duncan was diagnosed with the Ebola virus on Sunday. He is in isolation at a Dallas hospital, where his condition is listed as serious but stable.
Possible prosecution
Also Thursday, Liberian authorities said Duncan will be prosecuted when he returns home for lying on his airport screening questionnaire.
With an Ebola epidemic raging in West Africa, passengers leaving Liberia are being screened for fever and are asked if they have had contact with anyone infected.
On the form obtained by The Associated Press and confirmed by a government official, Duncan answered "no" to questions about whether he had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of someone who had died in an area affected by Ebola.
Days before he left Liberia, Duncan had helped carry to a taxi a pregnant woman who later died of Ebola, according to neighbors and reported by AP. Her illness at the time was believed to be pregnancy-related.
US measures
Public health authorities have been calling on U.S. health care workers to screen patients for signs of illness, question patients about their travel history and rule out Ebola for those who have been to West Africa, where more than 3,000 people have died in the epidemic.
“Unfortunately, that did not happen in this case,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We just need to put that behind us and look ahead and make sure that in the future that doesn't happen again.”
Duncan flew to Texas from Liberia via Brussels and Washington. He arrived in the United States on September 20, and five days later went to the hospital with a low-grade fever and abdominal pain.
CNN reported that a Dallas woman who had a child with Duncan said he had sweated profusely in the bed they shared at her apartment. She said the sheets where he had lain were still on the bed.
Hospital officials said Duncan told an emergency room nurse he had come from Liberia, but admitted his travel information had not been shared with other staff who were treating him.
Duncan was sent home with antibiotics but returned two days later.
‘Defeating Ebola’ conference
Also on Thursday, Britain made a plea for international help to deal with the world's worst Ebola outbreak at the start of a conference in London, with one charity warning that five people are being infected with the virus every hour in Sierra Leone.
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond speaks as he holds a press conference with British International Development Secretary Justine Greening at an Ebola conference at Lancaster House in London, Oct. 2, 2014.
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for "decisive action" to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, urging countries to increase financial aid as well as provide other vital help including medical expertise, transport and supplies.
Hammond told the "Defeating Ebola" conference Thursday in London that such action could save hundreds of thousands of lives and prevent the crisis from getting further out of control.
“We’re at a tipping point in the management of this Ebola outbreak, we've got more than 20 countries coming together here and we’re hoping that the commitments and the pledges that are made today will allow us to make a step change in our response, get ahead of the curve so that we can contain and then beat this disease," he said.
Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma, due to attend Thursday's conference, had to cancel because of technical problems with his plane.
Ebola has killed at least 3,338 in West Africa - mainly in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - out of 7,178 cases as of September 28, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, and cases have been recorded elsewhere, including in the United States.
'Simply wrong'
Even with the rise in cases reported by WHO, Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the Ebola crisis is stabilizing in her country and new data will soon prove that warnings from U.S. and U.N. experts of tens of thousands of cases were “simply wrong.”
The comments, made to France 24's English news channel late on Wednesday, follow forecasts from the WHO that 20,000 people could be infected with Ebola by early November.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned of hundreds of thousands of cases if swift action is not taken.
“We are beginning to see a stabilization - even in Monrovia, which has been hit the hardest,” Johnson Sirleaf said, referring to Liberia's capital city.
Liberia has recorded the most deaths - nearly 2,000 - and aid agencies said they still need hundreds of beds for Ebola patients in the capital.
The lack of beds means Ebola patients are being turned away and sent back to their communities, further spreading the infection.
However, Sirleaf rejected the negative warnings.
“I am waiting for the next projections and I hope they will admit that they've just been simply wrong, that all of our countries are getting this thing under control,” she said.
Although WHO said the total number of new cases had fallen for a second week, it warned of under-reporting and said there were few signs of the epidemic being brought under control.
“Transmission remains persistent and widespread in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with strong evidence of increasing case incidence in several districts,” the WHO said.
Getting a jump on donations
Britain and Sierra Leone arranged the event to spotlight the scale of the outbreak and ask for international support ahead of a donor conference planned for later this month.
Britain is the top international donor to Sierra Leone and has taken the lead on trying to combat the crisis there. It has pledged $200 million and has also provided nearly 150 new treatment beds and promised around 600 more in the coming months.
Aid group Save the Children highlighted the lack of treatment capacity in Sierra Leone, saying treatment facilities there currently offer only 327 beds.
Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said nurses are a major priority.
“We need to get nurses and in these countries there was only a thousand nurses before this crisis in Sierra Leone, a country of 6 million people. And even less than that in Liberia," Forsyth said. "So we need to act now and the people are the critical part of this as well as the money.”
The latest WHO figures report 788 new cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone in the past three weeks.
Save the Children warned that even with the Britain's planned aid, more capacity will be needed to avoid having infected people staying at home and risking passing the virus on to their families.
Aid cuts
In a critical report published on Monday, British politicians said international aid cuts to Sierra Leone and Liberia have compromised the fight against the virus.
Britain’s Department for International Development, or DFID, had planned to cut its bilateral budget for the two countries by a fifth between the 2013-14 fiscal year and 2015/16.
International Development Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce told VOA that Britain must stand by its long-term commitments to these countries.
“For countries like this that are emerging out of conflict, we really have to work with them over years to build up an effective health system so that they can manage both the normal day-to-day disease that they face and also have the resilience to deal with a crisis like this, which clearly has overwhelmed them," Bruce said.

Russia’s Syrian Escalation Tests Obama’s Crisis Response
WHITE HOUSE —
As Russia lobbed missiles into the skies over Syria, Republican leaders lobbed their own missive against President Barack Obama this week.
“From repeatedly seeking to declare some arbitrary end to the war on terror, to discarding the tools we have to wage it, to placing unhealthy levels of trust in unaccountable international organizations - the president’s foreign policy has been as predictable as it has been ineffectual,” Mitch McConnell said.
The Senate majority leader spoke Wednesday, as Moscow launched cruise missiles on extremist targets in Syria from its warships in the Caspian Sea.
“Dissatisfied powers like Russia, China and Iran are all looking to exploit American withdrawal in pursuit of regional hegemony and dreams of empire,” McConnell said on the Senate floor during a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act.
The Republican leader is not alone in his concerns about Russian involvement in Syria.
Syria tests Obama's crisis response
As the country’s air campaign dominates headlines, critics of the administration are once again questioning whether the American president has been slow to act on the Syrian conflict, thus creating an opening for powers like Russia.
During a press conference last week, Obama hit out at such criticism.
“When I hear people offering up half-baked ideas as if they are solutions, or trying to downplay the challenges involved in this situation - what I’d like to see people ask is, specifically, precisely, 'What exactly would you do?'” the president shot back.
During a lengthy explanation to a reporter’s question on Syria, Obama said people are looking for an “easy, low-cost answer” to a “hugely difficult, complex problem.”
He cited lessons learned from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the United States spent enormous time, effort and resources.
“When I make a decision about the level of military involvement that we're prepared to engage in, in Syria, I have to make a judgment based on, once we start something we’ve got to finish it. And we’ve got to do it well. And do we, in fact," Obama asked, "have the resources and the capacity to make a serious impact?”
What drives presidential action
This is classic President Obama, Georgetown University professor Stephen Wayne says.
From the outset of his presidency, Obama has demanded a diverse set of views, basing decisions on information not emotion.
“He is very rational, does not demonstrate a lot of emotion and doesn’t want to be the first African American president to make a major mistake. So he errs on the side of caution. And caution means you go slowly rather than go quickly. That’s the nature of the man,” Wayne said.
The Georgetown government professor says while the Middle East may be in worse shape than when Obama took office, the president is not to blame for a perceived failure to act, particularly in Syria.
"In a democracy, you can’t move without extended public support. He does not have the public [support]. He made the statement about chemical weapons in Syria, that we are going to bomb them. Then he looked at the polls and there was no support for a military response,” Wayne said.
No president can predict what’s going to happen, but George Washington University’s Matthew Dallek says the question is how quickly an administration senses when an issue becomes one that commands presidential attention.
The political management professor draws parallels to former President Bill Clinton, who was criticized for not acting quickly and decisively to put an end to Serbian atrocities in Kosovo during the late 1990s.
“In part he is judged on the result. That military campaign from the air was seen as a success, even though for many years, his critics were saying he was doing very little to nothing and really was AWOL and really this moral abject failure to intervene in the Balkans,” Dallek said.
Whether it be the spread of Ebola in West Africa or Islamic State militants in the Middle East, analysts say ultimately the president’s response to a crisis is driven by a variety of factors – whether it be media coverage, public support for action or simply how much an issue means to the commander-in-chief.
“A lot of people see it thorough a partisan lens. This administration would also say, and somewhat rightly so, that ‘we had the foresight to take the initiative with Cuba, to take the initiative on the Iran nuclear agreement, to try to take the lead on climate change,’” Dallek noted. “So, it partly depends on what people’s priorities are and what they see as the most important issue.”

Liberia Sets December 25 Goal: No New Ebola Cases
The hardest hit of the West African nations facing the deadly Ebola outbreak, Liberia, has set a national goal of recording no new cases by Christmas, December 25.
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said in a nationwide radio address Sunday that her country's path to recovery will be difficult. She said Liberia's health care system must be better prepared for any future disease epidemic, with sharp improvements also needed in the country's economy and governance.
She shifted several cabinet officials, saying it was necessary to appoint a team of officials "that is understanding of the prevailing challenges."
More than 2,800 of West Africa's 5,165 Ebola deaths have been recorded in Liberia.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., authorities reported that a surgeon, Doctor Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, is "extremely ill."

Ebola Death Toll Rises, But Virus 'Contained' in Nigeria, Senegal
The World Health Organization says Ebola outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal appear to have been stopped, though the regional death toll from the disease has climbed past 2,800.
A report from the WHO's Africa office said there have been no new cases of Ebola reported in Nigeria since September 8 and none in Senegal since the country's first and only case was reported on August 29.
It said the outbreaks in both countries "are pretty much contained."
A separate WHO report said Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone continued to report new cases of the disease. It said the total number of cases in West Africa has risen to 5,864 and the number of deaths has increased to 2,811.
It said an unrelated Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has infected 71 people and killed 40.
The numbers do not include 130 new Ebola cases found in Sierra Leone during a three-day nationwide lockdown that ended late Sunday.
The government had ordered the country's six million people to stay home as health workers went door-to-door trying to educate people on how to avoid spreading or contracting Ebola.
Sierra Leone's chief medical officer, Brima Kargbo, told VOA authorities asked people not to hide family members infected with Ebola or to keep corpses in their homes.
"Once we go to a home, we educate people, then they would tell us here we have a person who is ill. And that person is then asked whether he or she is linked to any Ebola-related patient, and once that has been established he or she is taken to a holding center, blood samples are taken and tested, and if they are positive they remain there in the holding center,” said Kargbo.
Sierra Leone's Health Ministry reported it reached 75 percent of its target of visiting 1.5 million homes during the lockdown. Officials said the outreach would continue in communities that have been identified as hot spots across the country.
Meanwhile, the U.S. military said about 60 personnel have arrived in West Africa as part of the U.S. effort to combat Ebola. A spokesman said Monday that another 30 to 40 would arrive on Tuesday.
The United States has committed $175 million to help combat the outbreak and is sending 3,000 troops to the region to build field hospitals and provide logistical aid.
On Monday, the WHO's Ebola emergency committee called for an end to flight cancellations and travel restrictions to the Ebola zone. It said these measures hampered international relief efforts and hurt the countries' economies.

Ebola Economic Toll Stirs W. Africa Food Security Concerns
LONDON —
The World Bank said Wednesday that it expects the Ebola outbreak will cost the sub-Saharan Africa economy about $3 billion to $4 billion, well below a previously outlined worst-case scenario of $32 billion. But some economists paint a gloomier picture, warning the disruption to regional markets and trading is considerable.
Fields of potatoes stretch to the horizon in Timbi-Madina, central Guinea. But the farmers there have no idea if they will be able to sell their crop. The Ebola epidemic is strangling the industry as borders with neighboring countries are closed.
Mamadou Diallo from the local farmers’ federation is worried.
“There are no plans to open the borders, and the internal market is not booming, everything is blocked,” he said. “So how long do we stock products for? And what price will be able to sell them at in the future?”
In the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, the prices of basic goods are rising. Mohamed Kamara is a wholesale trader there.
He says that most of the bulk buyers who come from the provinces are not coming to town due to Ebola, because their areas have been quarantined. So the prices right now are very high.
In Sierra Leone, 80 percent of the population works in agriculture and there has been a sharp decline in activity, says Professor Jonathan Leape, executive director of the International Growth Center at the London School of Economics.
“The food prices have not shown the kind of spikes that would have happened had there been shortages." he said. "What is not so good as a picture is what is happening to the level of trading and employment in these markets. There’s been a 69 percent drop in rice traders. That’s suggesting that employment and trading and buying and selling activity is dropping quite significantly.”
Companies hit hard
Multinational companies are also hit. British extraction company London Mining was already suffering from plunging iron ore prices. Several workers were removed from the company’s mine in Sierra Leone because of Ebola. This month the firm declared bankruptcy.
The mining sector is vital to Sierra Leone’s economy, says Alhaji Jalloh, president of the Sierra Leone Importers Association.
“Importation has been grounded to a halt; in fact exportation now is virtually zero. Our mining companies [have] closed down, most of them,” said Jalloh.
It is rarely necessary for companies in Ebola-affected regions to completely cease operations, says Dr. Katie Geary, medical director of the assistance group International SOS.
“What we are trying to get them to balance is the tension between business continuity and delivering the key economic requirements of that company, versus the safeguarding of their employees," she said. "Identifying the key people out there, making sure there’s education, making the work environment as safe as possible in the context of Ebola.”
When the epidemic is brought under control, the international community must help revive the region’s economy, says Leape.
“These countries will have a great need to re-launch their economies," he said. "And part of that means being very open and supportive of increasing international trade, but also taking measures that enhance and kick-start domestic trade.”
The human cost of Ebola is clear, more than 5,000 deaths to date. Analysts warn the international community must help avert an economic disaster.

Development of Antibodies Rushed to Treat Ebola Outbreak in Guinea
Amid a deadly outbreak of Ebola virus in the western African country of Guinea, an international team of researchers has stepped up production of experimental antibodies that scientists say have the potential to cure people infected with the virus, which has a 90 percent fatality rate.
Twenty laboratories and research sites around the world, including in Canada, Japan, Israel, Uganda, and the United States are working simultaneously to develop manmade antibodies against Ebola virus. Antibodies are frontline immune system proteins the body makes naturally to fight illness when first exposed to an infection.
Immune system proteins targeting Ebola, when administered by injection, have a high cure rate in animal experiments, says Erica Ollmann Saphire, an immunologist with Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.
“We have done a lot of experiments in non-human primates and if you can get the antibody into them within 48 hours after exposure, you can save nearly all of the animals. And even if you wait four or five days - say, someone that did not know they had been exposed - you wait four or five days for that animal to develop complete hemorrhagic fever, you can save more than half,” said Saphire.
Ingesting the disease
The disease, contracted through consumption of infected bats and tainted bush meat, quickly causes severe headache, fever and muscle aches before patients develop full-blown symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and hemorrhaging.
The United States has contributed $28 million to an effort aimed at determining which of the half dozen or so antibodies being developed around the world are the most effective in fighting the deadly virus. A successful treatment for Ebola may ultimately contain a mix of several antibodies.
Saphire is leading the research effort, which is being coordinated by the Scripps Institute. She says normally, it takes several days for the body to make antibodies against an infection, time which most Ebola patients do not have.
“It is a way to make somebody immediately immune ... And so the idea is that we have gotten these antibodies either from cells donated by survivors or by immunizing mice, and we humanize the antibodies; we can just take these things that we have grown in cell culture and give them to you right now to protect you from your infection that you have immediately without, you know, having to wait four days,” she said.
Antibodies and virology
Saphire said limited supplies of the antibodies, so far untested in humans, have been sent to Guinea to help Ebola victims.
The global effort to develop an antibody drug against Ebola, Saphire said, is unique in the world of virology.
“And so that kind of the magnificent thing about this is that the whole field is contributing to the study to come up with the single best treatment available in the world. So, it is not going to be the Canadian treatment versus the American treatment versus competing labs. Everyone is on the same page in one set of ... experiments,” she said.
In the early stages, Ebola can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases that are endemic to Africa, including malaria and cholera. So, diagnostic tests also have been sent to Guinea and neighboring countries to aid in detection and efforts to treat those infected with the virus.

Report: Ebola Far Deadlier for Young Children
Ebola appears to do its damage worse in young children than it does in adults, killing 90 percent of children under the age of one who become infected, a new study has found.
The joint study by the World Health Organization and Imperial College London found that, although infection rates are lower in children than adults, babies and toddlers who get the disease have a far slimmer chance of survival.
The virus, which causes haemorrhagic fever and induces internal and external bleeding, is killing 90 percent of infants in the current outbreak and around 80 percent of children ages between one to four years, the scientists found.
More than 23,000 people have contracted Ebola and more than 10,000 have died since the outbreak began more than a year ago. The West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have been hardest hit.
Also Wednesday, the WHO said while the outbreak seems be coming under control, Guinea remains a concern.
Seventy-nine new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the three countries during the week, the lowest weekly total recorded this year. However, 45 of them were in Guinea. Liberia suffered a setback, reporting its first new case in three weeks.
The WHO cautioned that authorities have yet to pin down and isolate the sources of new cases. It urged all parties to remain vigilant.

Sierra Leone Emergency Call Center Faces Daily Challenges
FREETOWN —
In Sierra Leone the number of Ebola cases continues to increase. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation says the country's death toll is now just over 1,000. Since August, a special emergency number, 117, has been used for people to call with any Ebola-related concerns. The call center is overwhelmed with calls daily.
Grace Kargobai, who has been working at the call center since August, says that she wanted to help her country as a first responder.
“It is interesting, it is fulfilling, especially with the kind of crisis we are having now, to feel you are a Sierra Leonean and helping people, it is fulfilling for me,” she said.
Calls to pick up a dead body or to check into a suspected Ebola case come here hourly.
The center used to be based at the World Health Organization office in Freetown. It was moved to a bigger location so it could have more staff.
The emergency number used to only exist for expectant mothers or those with children under five. It shifted gears to serve the Ebola crisis but people still call about other health-related matters too.
Around-the-clock operation
The center currently gets about 1,250 calls per day.
There are about 52 employees per shift and the center operates around the clock, seven days a week.
The job can be hard because many calls are from people saying Ebola is not real.

“So most of the time when you have calls like that and they don’t give you the opportunity to explain, what’s really the importance of not touching somebody, who is sick.. that’s the most challenging aspect of the job,” says Kargobai.
The center often gets complaints from the public saying it is too slow to respond.
First responders are actually just the first point of contact and still have to call surveillance teams to collect bodies, explains another first responder, Victoria Dyka.
“We at 117, are not ones responsible to go and take bodies, the sick people, but they [callers] think we are the ones responsible for that, so they will get mad, say we are not doing our work, but we have to understand that they are going through too much pressure, so we have to be wiser with them, speak nicely and some will eventually calm down,” she said.
Another challenge is prank calls. Reynold Senesi, the call center manager, says staff receive a high number of them everyday.
“The system we have can only accommodate a small volume of calls, but with the number of pranks calls coming from all angles, it really makes it difficult for those who need us, to reach us,” said Senesi.
He adds they are talking with the police and the military to look at ways of bringing the prank callers to justice.
Growing need
In the meantime, staff continue to come and do their job with pride. Senesi is hopeful the increased international response will help ease the pressure on his workers.
“We’ve got a lot of ambulances coming in, we have more [medical] personnel being trained, we have the Cubans coming in, the British, the South Africans, so they all are adding to human resources that we really need,” said Senesi.
And because cases continue to increase, including in Freetown, the center will soon move again, once again to a bigger location.

US, African Union Sign Deal to Form African Disease Agency
CHICAGO —
The United States and the African Union signed an agreement on Monday to create the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chairperson of the African Union Commission, signed a memo of cooperation formalizing the collaboration between the African Union Commission and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The West African Ebola epidemic reaffirmed the need for a public health institute to support African ministries of health and other health agencies in their efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to any disease outbreak,” CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said in a statement.
The African CDC is slated to launch later this year with the opening of a surveillance and response unit, which will provide technical expertise and help coordinate response to health emergencies, the statement said.
As part of the agreement, the U.S. CDC will send two public health experts to serve as long-term technical advisers to the African CDC. The United States will also support fellowships for 10 African epidemiologists to help staff five regional African CDC coordinating centers which are being established to help monitor disease activity on the continent.

Governments, Competitors Cooperate to Produce Ebola Vaccine
The worst Ebola outbreak in history is in its second year, and scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine against the virus. Since December of 2013, when the Ebola outbreak began in West Africa, the World Health Organization reports more than 20,000 people have been infected with the virus, and of those, more than 8,000 people have died.
These researchers are working on a vaccine that could be among the first to be used in West Africa's Ebola epidemic. This laboratory near Rome is owned by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK.
Several teams are working on Ebola vaccines. All say they have sped up the production process because of the urgent need and the number of lives at risk. In November, GSK said the first trial of this vaccine was well-tolerated and produced an immune response in all of the 20 healthy adult volunteers who received it.
The GSK vaccine promotes the production of antibodies and also triggers an immune response of certain cells which destroy infected cells. Dr. Riccardo Cortese heads this laboratory.
"The Ebola virus can't be kept under control by a vaccine that stimulates antibodies only. There is solid evidence that traditional vaccines are not enough. Our vaccine. instead, also stimulates another important branch of the immune system, the one that stimulates killer T cells that are able to recognize infected cells. The combination between two strategies is effective against Ebola," said Cortese.
GSK says more trials are still needed before the vaccine will be ready for widespread use.
Merck, another pharmaceutical giant, announced it is resuming trials of a vaccine known by the code name VSV-ZEBOV. A trial of this vaccine was suspended December 11, 2014, after some of the volunteers reported having mild joint pain. Trials are continuing with a lower dose of the potential vaccine.
The situation in West Africa has created unusual partnerships. At a recent forum in Washington, Dr. Julie Gerberding, the president of Merck, said even rival pharmaceutical companies are working together.
"There are some very special partnerships that are going on here. And one of them is the partnership between the people who are traditionally competitors," said Gerberding.
Several potential vaccines are being developed and are now in clinical trials. This increases the possibility of developing at least one that is effective against Ebola. And if more than one is effective, so much the better. It would increase the chances of that large numbers of people could be immunized, and bring the outbreak to an end. It could also mean there would never again be another Ebola epidemic as bad as this one.

Obama to Detail Robust US Response to Ebola Outbreak
WHITE HOUSE —
President Barack Obama is set to outline his plan to boost the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 2,400 people in West Africa. The president travels to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta Tuesday for a briefing with health experts leading American efforts to stem the outbreak.
The president’s visit to the CDC comes amid calls from West African leaders and international health officials for the United States to do more to assist nations that are struggling to keep up with an epidemic that the center’s director, Dr. Tom Frieden, recently said is spiraling out of control.
Near daily images of patients lying on the ground and left to die are coming out of countries like Liberia.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington Monday that because of its capabilities, the United States had a unique responsibility to step up in the midst of this international crisis.
“Our doctors and scientists are some of the best in the world, and we are going to deploy their knowledge and resources to try to help some of the governments in Africa meet the needs of their people and try to confront this very difficult challenge,” he said.
Earnest would not give details on President Obama’s announcement Tuesday to increase the U.S. “whole-of-government” response to Ebola. But The Wall Street Journal on Monday quoted officials who said the president was considering sending more portable hospitals, doctors, supplies and experts to train health care workers in Liberia and other affected countries.
So far, the United States has committed $100 million towards the fight since March, with the CDC also sending 100 of its workers to the region, among the largest such deployments in the U.S. agency’s history.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States must do more.
“Making an investment here early is critical to trying to snuff out this problem before it becomes a much more widespread problem. And that is the strategy that we are trying to implement here is to try to invest early,” he said.
In a recent interview with NBC-TV's Meet the Press, President Obama said while Ebola did not pose an imminent threat to Americans, containing the outbreak was a top national security priority.
“If we don’t make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa, but other parts of the world, there is the prospect that the virus mutates. It becomes more easily transmittable. And then it could be a serious danger to the United States,” he said.
In that interview, President Obama went on to say that the U.S. military would be helping set up isolation units and equipment, while providing security for international aid workers dealing with the crisis on the ground.

World Health Organization's Ebola Response Draws Criticism
LONDON —
The head of the World Health Organization has admitted that there were problems with the organization's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa but says history will be the ultimate judge of the results.
A WHO memo leaked last month suggested that incompetent staff and a lack of information had hampered efforts to stop the disease from spreading.
Questioned on the issue Wednesday, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan acknowledged there had been problems.
“There will be time for history and we will reveal how the whole world and especially WHO managed the Ebola outbreak," she said. "But at this point in time it is important for us to focus our entire energy and attention to help countries that are being affected to get the job done.”
The Ebola outbreak has laid bare an institution in crisis, said global health policy expert Sophie Harman of Queen Mary University of London.
“The World Health Organization should have had a clear leadership role in the Ebola response," Harman said. "But increasingly we see bilateral organizations such as the U.K. Department for International Development, or the U.S. government taking a lead role. Multilaterally, it has really been the World Bank that is stepped up in this regard.”
The World Bank pledged an extra $100 million last month for the fight against Ebola. Several U.N. agencies also have been involved.
“We have multiple institutions but nobody really directing where these energies should be going towards,” Harman said.
U.S. efforts
The United States has taken on the biggest burden in funding and manpower.
The first group of service members from the U.S. Ebola mission returned Tuesday to Texas. Other countries, including China and European states, have faced criticism for their contributions.
“We still have seen some of the major global donors, the EU, are not stepping up," said Barry Johnston, head of advocacy at ActionAid, a charity working in the region. "And it is only really when it is worrying them, when it is starting to threaten their own doors, that they are prepared to respond.”
The European Union’s health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, visited Sierra Leone this week and called for EU states to do more.
“I appeal to the EU member states to encourage health workers and volunteers, especially epidemiologists, to put hesitation and fear aside and go to West Africa to help fight Ebola now,” Andriukaitis said.
Profits rerouted
Despite the hundreds of millions pledged, campaigners say global efforts to fund the fight against Ebola are being undermined, because multinational companies are shifting profits away from West Africa and weakening local economies.
“ActionAid looked at the three countries affected by the Ebola crisis — Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia — and found that in 2011, the last year that figures were available, those countries actually lost more money to tax avoidance than they were able to spend on their health services," Johnson said.
Analysts say rebuilding those health systems will be the crucial next step for the international community. For now, all efforts are directed at containing the disease.

Sierra Leone’s Koroma: Ebola a ‘Battle We Must Not Lose’
UNITED NATIONS —
The president of Sierra Leone has urged his people and the world not to become complacent about the Ebola virus, saying this is a battle "we cannot lose."
Sierra Leone’s President Earnest Bai Koroma is in New York this week to participate in an international Ebola recovery conference at the United Nations. His country, Guinea and Liberia are the epicenter of the health crisis that began last year, infecting more than 27,000 people in the three West African countries and killing more than 11,000.
Liberia on Thursday announced two new cases of the disease, and Sierra Leone said it will extend a curfew in Ebola-affected areas.
President Koroma warned that people are becoming complacent as the cases dwindle to a handful. He told VOA in an interview that the international community must remain focused on getting Ebola cases to zero, because only then will it be beaten.
“But until Ebola is completely out, we will not stop, we must continue this fight. We will encourage them to stay focused. It has been difficult for all of us. But that is where we find ourselves, and this is a battle we must not lose,” he said.
President Koroma said Ebola has reversed the substantial gains his country has made since the end of its civil war in 2002. Economic growth has stopped, the health sector must be rebuilt, schools need to reopen, people need jobs and investment needs to resume. He said he is asking for close to $1 billion at the U.N. conference for his country’s recovery.
“Ebola has not isolated us as a region or as nations. We still have great potentials, we are still prepared to do business and are preparing to do business… We still want to get to where we were before Ebola struck,” he said.
“It is a terrible situation to be in,” Koroma added, especially when the country is on a positive path. But with international support, he said, Sierra Leone can get to zero cases and stay there and begin the road to national recovery.

WHO: Ebola Death Toll Nears 8,000
The World Health Organization on Monday released the latest figures on the Ebola epidemic, with the number of suspected, probable and confirmed cases reaching 20,081, almost entirely in West Africa.
The Ebola death toll stands at 7,842, with all but a few deaths occurring in three countries: Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Those are the reported figures; health authorities repeatedly have warned the actual numbers of infections and deaths likely are much higher.
As of December 27, hardest-hit Sierra Leone accounted for almost half of all cases, at 9,409, while Liberia had the highest death toll, 3,413.
Meanwhile, a health care worker who returned from Sierra Leone has been diagnosed with Ebola and is being treated in a Glasgow hospital, Scottish authorities said Monday.
The current Ebola outbreak claimed its first victim last December and, according to medical experts, is likely to last until the end of 2015.
This has been the worst outbreak since the disease was identified in Central Africa in 1976.

WHO: Traditional Burials Hamper Ebola Fight
World Health Organization officials say traditional burial practices are among the obstacles that are making it difficult to control the worst Ebola outbreak in West Africa's history.
WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said health and relief workers have been trying to educate families in the affected region about how to bury their loved ones without exposing themselves to the virus.
He said people who touch the dead could be putting themselves at risk.
"At the moment when a person died from Ebola, this is the moment when the person is the most infectious and when the viral load is the highest," he said.
Dangerous practice
Jasarevic has been working with local officials in Guinea and Sierra Leone. In many cultures, he said, families wash the bodies of their loved ones before burial, but this practice is dangerous for Ebola victims because of the presence of bodily fluids.
"Usually there is the point just before the death, there is bleeding," he said.
Jasarevic also said their could be vomit or diarrhea.
Peter Schleicher, a Red Cross operations manager in Liberia, said another obstacle for relief workers in affected communities is fear, explaining that people in some communities have prevented trained health professionals from safely burying Ebola victims.
"We got a report back from one of our teams in the field that they have now been blocked by the angry community and they have been denied access," he said.
Schleicher said the team members were told to turn back to keep from putting themselves at risk.
He said relief workers have been trying to alleviate fears and inform communities that Ebola victims can be safely buried by trained specialists, who take extra precautions.
"The body will be disinfected and then be put into one body bag and disinfected again," he said.
"And this body bag will be put into the outer body bag. So actually, one body will be using two body bags," said Schleicher.
He said relief workers are sensitive to fears and burial traditions. But they have been trying to persuade communities to heed their advice, and allow trained specialists to handle the bodies of Ebola victims.

DRC Sends Ebola Expert to Help Liberia Combat Disease
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) sent its Ebola virus expert to Liberia to help combat the disease following an official request by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s government, according to DRC information minister Lambert Mende.
Mende said President Joseph Kabila has made available Prof J.J. Muyembe, Director of the National Institute for Biomedical Research-INRB, and professor of Microbiology, Kinshasa University medical school, available to Liberia following an official request by the government in Monrovia.
“We sent our big specialist of this disease Prof. Muyembe who went to Liberia to help our brothers of Liberia,” said Mende.
Mende also sought to tamp down speculation that the sickness in the remote northern Equateur province that left several people dead was Ebola.
He said health minister Dr. Felix Kabange Numbi and his team have launched an inquiry into the yet to be determined disease.
“Since this case occurred in West Africa, we have put in a system where whenever we hear a disease can be similar to the Ebola case, a team of the [health] ministry moves very quickly to take sample and start inquiring and sending it to Atlanta or anywhere to make sure [it’s not Ebola],” said Mende.
He said test results could determine the type of disease affecting northern Equateur province, which will help inform the government’s medical plan to combat it.
Mende says it is too soon to speculate whether the disease is indeed Ebola. He called for calm and urged the population to allow the medical team to complete its assessment of the situation in the province.
“There is no result up to now to say [exactly] what is going on there. We are waiting, but there is no report that we have Ebola here in this country. No, not at all,” said Mende. “No [need to] panic.”
He said the government implemented new measures to isolate and treat cases of the Ebola virus in the capital, Kinshasa.
“We have deployed teams [to] all borders to investigate any person entering the country, medically and we have made here in Kinshasa town where many people come from abroad eight hospitals are ready to receive any case of such,” said Mende. “We have equipped them, we have sent in personnel. We have good experience with this disease that was seen here years ago.”
Mende says the government has begun screening all international travelers who visit the country for signs of Ebola virus irrespective of the country they came from.
“All international airports, all ports are now equipped with materials to screen every passenger that is disembarking here in Kinshasa from every country. Not only from West Africa,” said Mende.

US Doctor: Ebola Quarantine May Deter Volunteers
A top U.S. medical official has warned that mandatory quarantines of health care workers returning from Ebola-affected parts of West Africa could discourage people from volunteering in the region.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's State of the Union program Sunday that the best way to protect Americans is to stop the outbreak in Africa, and one of the best ways to do that is to help health workers who go there, rather than take measures that may "disincentivize them from going."
His comments follow new quarantine policies being imposed by three U.S. states.
New York, New Jersey and Illinois have imposed a mandatory three-week quarantine for anyone returning from West Africa who had exposure to Ebola patients.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie defended his state's quarantine, calling it necessary "to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey."
US ambassador to UN
Meanwhile U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power landed in Conakry, Guinea, on Sunday to see first-hand how the global response is failing to stop the deadly spread of Ebola in West Africa.
Power, who will also visit Liberia and Sierra Leone, said she hopes to gain a better understanding of which resources are missing so she can push other countries to offer more help.
The three West African countries are bearing the brunt of the worst outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever on record that the World Health Organization (WHO) says has killed nearly 5,000 people. A small number of cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States.
She told reporters on Saturday that the benefits of having first-hand knowledge of what is going on there far outweigh what she calls the "almost nonexistent risk."
A small number of cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States.
“We are not on track right now to bend the curve,” Power told Reuters. “I will take what I know and I learn and obviously provide it to President (Barack) Obama, who's got world leaders now on speed dial on this issue.
“Hopefully the more specific we can be in terms of what the requirements are and what other countries could usefully do, the more resources we can attract,” she said.
Lack of beds, medical staff
According to the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), even if existing international commitments are met by December, there could be a shortage of over 6,000 beds across Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Nearly half of the beds currently planned in the three West African countries will lack the medical staff needed to support them, a study by former British prime minister Tony Blair's London-based development consultancy found.
AGI based its projections on the WHO's worst-case scenario, which foresees 10,000 new cases per week in December.
“The international community badly misjudged the impact of the Ebola epidemic in its first few months and is compounding that error by failing to act quickly enough now,” AGI's chief executive Nick Thompson said.
He called upon more countries to follow the examples of the United States, Britain and Cuba, which have deployed military and medical personnel to the region to bolster efforts to stop the epidemic at its source.
Power will visit Ebola coordination centers and meet with top government officials, U.S. health experts and military forces combating the disease.
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are at the center of the Ebola crisis, which has killed nearly 5,000 of the more than 10,000 confirmed and suspected cases.
The WHO said the true numbers may be higher because many families have tried to treat patients at home.
Ebola diagnostic test
In another development, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of two new diagnostic developed tests by an American firm that can detect Ebola in a blood or urine sample in about an hour, compared to the 24 to 48 hours required for current tests.
The FDA has been working with the Utah-based Bio-Fire to obtain the necessary performance data to grant the emergency authorization.
Also Saturday, the United Nations flew one metric ton of emergency relief supplies to Mali after it reported its first Ebola death.
A 2-year-old girl from Guinea died Friday in Mali, where she had gone for treatment.
The WHO said the girl arrived by bus and may have exposed others in Mali to the disease.
The World Food Program director for West Africa, Denise Brown, said speed is of the essence in the Ebola crisis.
Meanwhile, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn has ordered a mandatory 21-day quarantine for so-called high-risk people arriving in the midwestern American state from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone.
The order covers anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient.
Quinn said the protective measure is too important to be voluntary. The governors of New Jersey and New York have also ordered quarantines.
The 21-day period marks the Ebola virus incubation period.
President Obama urged Americans in his weekly Saturday radio address "to be guided by the facts, not fear" in the fight against Ebola. He again reminded Americans how difficult it is to catch the disease.
Someone has to come in direct contact with an infected patient's bodily fluids to contract Ebola.

W. African Travelers to US Told to Monitor Health for Ebola
U.S. federal health authorities are ordering travelers from three West African countries to monitor their health for 21 days and report daily for any signs of Ebola.
The visitors would be from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.
The monitoring program will start Monday in six eastern states where the majority of those travelers would visit -- Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
The travelers will be given an Ebola kit when they arrive at airports, including a thermometer.
Officials say 21 days represent the maximum incubation period for Ebola.
On Wednesday, President Barack Obama held his first official meeting with his new "Ebola czar," Ron Klain. His job is to coordinate anti-Ebola efforts of multiple U.S. government agencies and aid groups.
After the talks, Obama said the Centers for Disease Control are working to make sure every American hospital has a plan to handle any Ebola case, so that the mistakes made in Dallas are not repeated.
Two nurses who treated a Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, at the Dallas hospital contracted the disease when precise procedures to protect them apparently were not followed. One nurse is hospitalized outside Washington. The other is in Atlanta.
Cuba health workers
While in Liberia, a fresh contingent of Cuban doctors and nurses arrived Wednesday to help to fight the worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus on record alongside a U.S. military mission deploying in the West Africa country.
The 83 doctors and nurses are the latest group of Cuban medical professionals sent to West Africa through an agreement with the World Health Organization.
The first group of 165 doctors and nurses deployed to Sierra Leone at the start of October and another group of around 40 medical staff was due to arrive in neighboring Guinea on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa could be contained within four to six months if the right steps are followed.
Elhadj As Sy told reporters Wednesday in China that the time frame was possible with good isolation and treatment for those with confirmed cases of Ebola, along with proper burials for those who died from the virus.
His comments come as the World Health Organization convenes a meeting of its Emergency Committee on Ebola to discuss the latest developments in the outbreak and whether to alter its recommendations.
The talks are expected to take one or two days, after which the WHO will give a briefing with the results.
Ebola vaccine
U.S. drug company Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday it was working with Danish health company Bavarian Nordic to develop an Ebola vaccine that was projected to begin safety testing in January. Johnson & Johnson said the vaccine would be delivered in two doses, two months apart.
The company said it was spending up to $200 million to accelerate and expand its Ebola research. It said it hoped to have vaccine doses ready for broad clinical trials by mid-2015.
On Tuesday, the WHO said that an experimental Ebola vaccine could be in use by January.
WHO assistant director Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny said clinical trials of Ebola vaccines are underway or planned in Europe, the United States and Africa.
Kieny said if the vaccines are deemed safe, there could be a West African trial in January, using tens of thousands of doses.
She did not say when an Ebola vaccine might be widely available.
Cameraman released
Nebraska Medical Center officials said American video journalist Ashoka Mukpo had recovered from Ebola and was released around 9 a.m. Wednesday from the hospital's biocontainment unit.
In a statement read at a news conference later, Mukpo said, in part: “Today is a joyful day.”
The hospital said Tuesday that Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus. He had arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center on Oct. 6 and was the second Ebola patient to be treated there. The first, Dr. Rick Sacra, has also recovered.
Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak, with more than 9,100 cases.
U.S. Homeland Security officials are requiring all U.S.-bound travelers from those three countries to arrive through one of five U.S. airports with enhanced Ebola screening.
The airports are in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Washington and Newark, New Jersey.
Ninety-four percent of travelers coming to the U.S. from those three countries arrive at these airports even during normal conditions.
Some information for this report was provided by AP, AFP and Reuters.

African Media Tries to Educate Public About Ebola
While the Ebola epidemic continues to claim lives in West Africa, information technology specialists, together with radio and TV reporters, are battling misinformation and prejudice about the disease - using social media to educate the public about the deadly virus. .
The World Health Organization says the current Ebola outbreak is the worst in history and will probably continue to spread for months through Western and Central Africa.
Most of the cases have occurred in remote villages, where people rely mostly on radio and television for the news.
In Ghana’s capital Accra, an announcer for the Citi 97.3 FM station reads the daily bulletin, “The deadly Ebola virus resurfaced in West Africa in February this year. Since then it has claimed more than 700 lives."
The station’s online manager, Mawuli Tsikata, says the government’s campaign to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS was much more aggressive than education about Ebola.
“In the case of Ebola you don't see anything; you just depend on what the journalists report to the public so I don't think the government is doing enough to educate the public about Ebola," Tsikata said.
The epidemic has also reached large cities, where a more affluent population has access to computers, the Internet and social media.
Blogger Japhet Omojuwa, based in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, says social media users are often some of the most influential people in the society, so reaching them can help spread the word about the danger of Ebola.
“They have access to those that are not on social media, so if they are interested, if they are made to know and understand the dangers and the risks of us not stopping Ebola from being a Nigerian issue, then they will likely get to reach their parents, their sisters, their cousins their relatives," said Omojuwa.
Social media activism against the Ebola outbreak is not confined to individual bloggers. The Nigerian group Hexavia Logistics hopes its tweets are reaching many, not only in Nigeria but other African countries as well.
General Manager Babajide Fadoju says it is unfortunate that it took an epidemic for the African public to start talking about Ebola.
“So the most important aspect of all things that we do is actually talking about it, hence talking about Ebola is one of the best things that has actually happened with the Ebola virus," said Fadoju.
The World Health Organization says it will work with affected countries and their neighbors, renewing efforts to improve communication and teach people how to avoid infection and where to seek help. African bloggers and tweeters are already doing their part.

West Accused of Draining Ebola-hit W. Africa of Doctors
LONDON —
Health systems in the West African countries worst hit by Ebola are struggling to contain the epidemic. A report from a British charity accuses Western countries of recruiting hundreds of doctors and nurses from Africa, severely weakening the frontline health services in the very countries where the disease has taken hold.
Amid the fear of the epidemic, a moment of joy for these patients in Sierra Leone.
Forty-five patients at the Hastings treatment center near the capital, Freetown, were confirmed to be Ebola-free on Wednesday. Fourteen-year-old survivor Hawanatu Turay expressed relief.
"I can eat fine, my stomach hurts no more, my head aches no more, and also my neck, nothing hurts and I have no more pains," said Turay.
The center is staffed exclusively by Sierra Leonean doctors. That’s rare in Sierra Leone’s crippled health system, says Martin Drewry, director of the charity Health Poverty Action.
“The important thing to remember is that whilst an Ebola outbreak is caused biologically, an Ebola epidemic is caused by a rundown, dysfunctional health system," said Drewry.
Drewry says under-investment is to blame - but so is the plundering by Western countries of health workers trained in Africa. A recent report from Health Poverty Action claims that Britain's National Health Service or NHS has recruited 10 percent of all Sierra Leone’s trained medical workers.
“Even before Ebola you had just 320 hospital beds in the whole of Sierra Leone. The system was that weak before Ebola. Now it’s incredibly weak and yet, at the same time, people like me in the UK are being treated by doctors and health workers whose training was paid for Sierra Leone. And that’s just wrong," he said.
In a statement, Britain's Department of Health said that 'health care professionals often want to spend time working in different health care systems to gain experience and skills.'
Martin Drewry says there is a compromise.
“We don’t want to stop people migrating at all. But if health workers from the poorest countries are coming to subsidize the health system of the richest countries, we should pay some compensation back into their health system to make up for that," said Drewry.
The British government highlights its leading role in the international fight against Ebola. London is deploying 750 military personnel. The United States is deploying 4,000 troops to fight Ebola in West Africa.
Those boots on the ground are vital in tackling Ebola, says Sophie Harman of Queen Mary University of London.
"If you send just money, you have a problem of what we call 'absorptive capacity'. Where does that money go? And how quickly can it take effect on the ground with helping these countries and the people that desperately need the resources?" Asked Harman.
Liberia is one of the worst hit countries. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf recently urged the hundreds of Liberian medics working overseas to return home. But her own son - a trained doctor - has opted to stay working in his adopted homeland of the United States, saying he can do more to fight the disease there.

Work on Ebola Treatments Speeds Up to Address Outbreak
The World Health Organization has approved the use of experimental drugs for people who have Ebola, a virus that already has claimed more than 1,000 lives in western Africa.
The experimental Ebola serum that was used on American and Spanish missionaries is produced in California at the Mapp Biopharmaceutical laboratory. The manufacturer says it has run out of the serum, but is trying to increase production as quickly as possible.
Other groups also are working on treatments and vaccines. Researchers at Newlink Genetics in Iowa say they have a vaccine that was 100 percent effective when given to monkeys. The company got a federal grant to ramp up its work and to speed up human testing.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health has approved a grant to the University of Texas Medical Branch to develop effective treatments for Ebola. Professor Thomas Geisbert is the lead researcher.
"That grant really is to focus on what we believe are three of the most promising post-exposure treatments against Ebola," said Geisbert.
All have proven effective in testing on monkeys. Professor Geisbert says the next step is human trials.
“One of the goals for this project is to actually try to combine these different treatments, for example with HIV there’s been a lot of success in combining different anti-viral drugs that operate by different mechanisms of action, and we believe that this is something that may work for Ebola as well," said Geisbert.
Since 1976, there have been more than 15 Ebola outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa, but no licensed treatments are available. Dr. Peter Hotez is an expert on tropical diseases. He founded the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
"The problem is that it’s a neglected tropical disease, where there’s no real commercial market for it, the major multi-national firms have not invested in these products," said Hotez.
As a result, researchers have to depend on grants from government and private sources and progress goes a lot slower. Too slow and too late for more than 1,000 people.

Nurse is Nigeria's 10th Case of Ebola
ABUJA/DAKAR —
Nigerian officials on Monday said one new Ebola case was diagnosed over the weekend, raising the country's total to 10 confirmed cases, while Ivory Coast banned air travel from West African nations heavily hit by the virus.
Since Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-American financial consultant, flew into Lagos from Liberia about three weeks ago, the number of new Ebola cases has slowly grown and the number of people who may have been exposed is growing, officials said.
Officials are now monitoring 177 people for symptoms of the disease.
Over the weekend, a 10th person who had an apparent connection with Sawyer was diagnosed with Ebola, said Onyebuchi Chukwu, Nigerian Minister of Health.
“It was one of the nurses that were primary contacts when he got ill. We then brought her into isolation and we just tested her over the weekend and she tested positive," Chukwu said.
Death tolls
Of the 10 cases of Ebola in Nigeria, there have been two deaths: Sawyer and a nurse who treated him when he first arrived in Lagos. The other eight cases are people who also had direct contact with Sawyer, Chukwu said.
Ebola has killed 961 people since the outbreak began early this year, with all but two deaths occurring in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Ebola is one of the world's most deadly diseases, with no known vaccine or cure. The Zaire strain - the one currently spreading through West Africa - can kill up to 90 percent of sufferers, although in the latest outbreak the death toll has been around 55 percent.
Reports that experimental drugs have had success in treating American and European health workers and missionaries who contracted the disease in West Africa have prompted many Nigerians to demand access to the drugs in case it spreads further.
“Nigeria is actually, as of now, reaching out to various laboratories, various governments, including the U.S.A. government to see how these untried ... drugs that seem to hold some hope could also be deployed in Nigeria. We’re in touch," Chukwu said.
The World Health Organization said it expects a vaccine to be developed by 2015, but currently there is no known cure.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan Friday pledged $11.7 million dollars to try to stop the spread in Nigeria and $3.5 million to help other countries fight the disease.
Chukwu said, so far in Nigeria, the disease has not spread out of Lagos, a megacity of 21 million people that is often called the "heartbeat" of the Nigerian economy.
Travel ban
As Nigeria joins the group of West African nations battling an Ebola outbreak, other countries are taking stronger measures to prevent the virus from entering its borders.
In Ivory Coast, the government has banned, until further notice, all passenger flights into the country from Liberia, Guinea or Seirra Leone, the three countries hardest hit by the virus.
Ivory Coast has not reported any cases of Ebola and government spokesman Bruno Kone said they want to keep it that way.
The government said in addition to the ban on flights, authorities at the Abidjan airport will be screening all arriving passengers for fever, using infrared thermometers. Fever can be one of the early symptoms of Ebola.
It can take up to 21 days for symptoms to appear, and once they do, a person is contagious. Other people can catch the disease by coming into contact with the sick person's bodily fluids.
While Ivory Coast shares land borders with two of the four affected countries - Liberia and Guinea - Health Minister Dr. Raymonde Goudou Coffie said it doesn’t make sense to shut those borders.
Coffie said the borders are very porous, and even if they close the official borders, people know other ways across.
Instead, she said, health officials have worked on educating villages and local leaders to have them refer new arrivals to health authorities.
Land borders closed
Liberia closed its land border with Ivory Coast last week in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus.
Ivory Coast’s defense minister said in “recent days,” border authorities have already repatriated "nearly 100 people" who have tried to cross illegally from Guinea or Liberia.
The Ivory Coast government said it continues to train health workers and will be holding a simulation drill later this week for first responders.
In Malawi, health authorities said the government was taking measures to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus into the country, including airport screenings of international passengers, critics said they weren’t doing enough.
Charles Mwansambo, director of health services in the Ministry of Health, told journalists in Lilongwe that the government was screening international passengers at the airports, and had set up quarantine centers at Kamuzu International Airport in the capital, Lilongwe, and Chileka Airport, in the commercial capital of Blantyre.
However, critics said that medical workers needed urgent training on how to handle an infected person, lacked specialized equipment for containing the virus and could improve public education efforts.
Ministry of Health officials said the airport screenings are currently done to those passengers from West African countries hit hardest by the Ebola virus - Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
Mwansambo said, “I want to assure the members of the general public not to panic because Ebola is spread by direct contact with bodily fluids like blood, saliva and urine. And chances of Malawians going to West Africa and getting in touch with these bodily fluids are very minimal.”
Criticizes rep
Juliana Lunguzi, chairwoman of Malawi’s Parliamentary Committee on Health, criticized his comments, saying there is no logic in telling people not to panic when the situation on the ground shows the government is doing nothing to prevent the outbreak.
Lunguzi, who is also a nurse, said her committee will soon summon government authorities to explain their readiness in terms of medical equipment for combating the possible spread of Ebola into the country.
Jonathan Gama, chairman of the Human Resources for Health coalition of health professionals in Malawi, said Malawi is not in any way ready to contain the virus.
Gama cited inadequate medical equipment, protective wear and orientation for health workers as among the signs of the country’s unpreparedness.
“What we are suggesting is that the health workers should be trained and after training them there should be procurement of resources as Ebola demands, so that when Ebola incidences appear in Malawi we should not be taken by surprise,” Gama said.
Lameck Masinan contributed to this report from Blantrye, Malawi.

New Ebola Guidelines for Health Workers Issued in US
WHITE HOUSE —
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has issued a new set of guidelines on how to handle health care workers returning from Ebola-affected countries of West Africa. The new guidelines come as the Obama administration clashes with state governments that have recently imposed quarantines on doctors and nurses who have been in Ebola zones.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest did not go as far as openly criticizing the governments of states like New York and New Jersey for requiring health workers coming from Ebola zones to be quarantined.
But he said any policy meant to protect Americans from Ebola should be based on science and should also consider the wider implications.
“We want to make sure that whatever policies are put in place in this country to protect the American public do not serve as a disincentive to doctors and nurses from this country volunteering to travel to West Africa to treat Ebola patients," said Earnest.
Earnest said people like Kaci Hickox are heroic. Hickox is the nurse who was quarantined in a tent by the U.S. state of New Jersey after she came back from working with Ebola patients in West Africa.
The case triggered outrage among some medical experts who criticized the measure as inhumane and unnecessary.
Meanwhile, a 5-year-old boy in New York tested negative for Ebola after arriving from Guinea with a low-grade fever.
The Obama administration has resisted calls for a travel ban or quarantines, saying the measures would hinder efforts to fight the disease at its source in West Africa.
The guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are only recommendations, and the federal government cannot force the states to adopt them.
Under U.S. law, federal authorities can detain, examine, and release people arriving in the U.S. who are suspected of carrying communicable diseases, but only the states have authority to enforce isolation and quarantine laws.
American ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power speaks to media in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Oct. 27, 2014.
The question came up Monday on whether Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, will be scrutinized upon her return after visiting Ebola-afflicted nations.
Officials said Power will abide by the health laws of the state in which she lands, but they noted she may not be subject to quarantine since she is not a health worker.
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Monday said Ambassador Power’s delegation did not have contact with people infected with Ebola.
“She is not visiting any Ebola treatment units. They are observing all hand-washing protocols and doing temperature screenings multiple times a day," said Psaki.
Also Monday, Pentagon officials said a small number of U.S. army soldiers deployed to help West African nations fight Ebola were put under quarantine at a base in Italy. Officials said none of the soldiers are exhibiting symptoms and are being watched only as a precaution.
White House officials continue to say the likelihood of a widespread outbreak on U.S. soil is extremely low.

Ebola Orphanage Opens in Sierra Leone
KAILAHUN, SIERRA LEONE —
Sierra Leone's first Ebola orphanage has opened in the Kailahun district. Hundreds of children orphaned since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak face stigma and rejection with nobody to care for them. A new interim care center is aimed at helping the growing number of children affected by Ebola.
UNICEF says more than 3,700 children across West Africa have lost one or both parents to Ebola. Doctors Without Borders' Axelle Vandoornick said the growing number of Ebola orphans is a crisis of its own.
“There are many orphans, this is again when we talk about crisis in a crisis this is one of the consequences at a social level. There are more and more orphans," said Vandoornick.
Child care services in Sierra Leone are almost non existent. Ministry of Health social services officer Doris Mansare is in charge of running Kailahun's first Ebola orphanage.
“And its difficult for us to find family members, so this interim care center was established to basically to insure that we get the children from the treatment center, those that are cured from the Ebola virus and also those that are with their parents, but then are negative. We bring them to the interim care center for three or four days, then they are reunified with family members at there respective locations,” said Mansare.
Rejection, vulnerability
These three siblings were living alone after both parents died of Ebola. Their village rejected them.
“We have children who are unaccompanied, they are just living alone in their family home, about 50 of such children, who are living alone,” said Mansare.
Vandoornick said it can be hard to find surviving family.
“Ebola is wiping out entire family's because the contamination inside the families is the highest. A mother kissing her child, a father taking his daughter in his arms, and when you have one suspected case in one family, soon after we have basically all members of the family,” said Vandoornick.
Uncertain future
The fate of many of these children is unclear. Some of their parents are still sick, kept in isolation at one of Sierra Leone’s Ebola case management centers.
Doris Mansare said she hopes the new center will help the growing number of orphans, but she worries about their future.
“We are having more orphans, more unaccompanied children and these children will become vulnerable in the future some will not be able to cope with the care givers where we place them, and what can happen is it will lead to other child protection issues like they becoming street children,” she said.
Vandoornick hopes there will be many child care centers set up across Sierra Leone.

Sierra Leone Quarantines 50 Following Latest Ebola Death
Sierra Leone Tuesday quarantined 50 people in the northern district of Kambia, where a 76 year-old woman died over the weekend from Ebola. The country had just celebrated the release from the hospital of its last known Ebola patient.
Abdulai Bayraytay, national publicity and outreach coordinator in the office of Sierra Leone’s government spokesman, told VOA the good news so far is that no one else has shown symptoms of the virus.
But Bayraytay said the woman’s death re-emphasizes the government’s warning for Sierra Leoneans to be vigilant, not intransigent. He described the current Ebola news as unfortunate.
“For us we are very much concerned, but the good thing though we have a quick intervention project whereby we were able to converge to the scene immediately and all those that are of immediate threat in terms of exposure were put on quarantine, and also the vaccine that was just approved for tryout in Guinea has now being administered just so that we don’t take any chances at all,” he said.
The woman who died was supposedly sick for 5 to 10 days without the authorities knowing of her situation. Still, Bayraytay said there is a remote possibility Sierra Leone may see new cases of Ebola
“From our understanding and investigation, this woman contracted the virus from a male survivor who didn’t meet the 90-day cycle and got infected and they were hiding it,” Bayraytay said.
He said the only sure way Sierra Leone would be able to defeat Ebola in the various communities is when people continue to utilize the 117 toll free telephone numbers. Bayraytay said by calling that number a person can get early diagnosis and possible support and treatment.
The latest Ebola death came as Sierra Leonean children returned to school Monday, bringing back memories of the many months that students were out of school last year because of the Ebola outbreak.
But Bayraytay said Sierra Leoneans will not be starting all over again. Instead, he said, the way to avert a repeat of last year’s outbreak is for Sierra Leoneans to continue to adhere to the medical measures and regulations that could lead to the eventual eradication of Ebola.

US Health Agency Expects More Cases Of Ebola Before Outbreak Ends
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has so far claimed 670 lives and infected more than 1,200 people. An expert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more cases can be expected in the coming weeks and months. Tealth agency is actively trying to stem the spread of the infection.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, downplays concerns that the Ebola virus could spread in the U.S., because of the practices already in place in most U.S. hospitals. Two American health care workers in Africa have contracted the disease.
In the past, the strain of Ebola that's circulating in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia has killed 90 percent of those who got sick. The CDC says the death rate for the current outbreak is around 60 percent, a figure experts claim shows that early treatment is having an impact.
Experts from the CDC are in West Africa, where they are working with the ministries of health and international health organizations to help keep track of the outbreak and coordinate resources to deal with it. The CDC's Stephan Monroe monitors emerging diseases. He spoke during a teleconference from the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.
"We know how to stop the outbreak and that is to break the chains of transmission. What does that involve? It involves first identifying cases through active case findings, and then identifying all of their contacts [people] who had contact with them during the time when they were symptomatic, and therefore are at risk of becoming infected themselves, and following those contacts daily for 21 days and if they do develop symptoms to get them into one of these isolation facilities," said Monroe.
Monroe says fear and misinformation are major factors in preventing people from seeking treatment. He said what the CDC and health organizations are trying to do is find trusted members of the affected communities to get the word out about how to contain the disease.
There are no specific drugs to treat Ebola. What health care workers can do is provide fluids and treat the early symptoms, which include high fever, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhea. The symptoms could also be mistaken for influenza or malaria, and unless patients are isolated and care givers avoid contact with the patient's blood, saliva or other bodily fluids, the disease can spread.

Health Officials Scramble to Contain Guinea Ebola Outbreak
DAKAR —
At least 59 people have died following an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Health officials are taking steps to contain the outbreak, including educating the public about ways to keep the virus from spreading.
Guinea’s Ministry of Health says there have been at least 86 suspected cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the country’s southeastern forest region since Feb. 9.
Liberia’s Ministry of Health says five people, who crossed the border from affected areas in Guinea into Lofa County for treatment, are believed to have died from Ebola.
Health officials are also investigating suspected cases in Sierra Leone.
Plan International is a non-profit that promotes children's development. The group's regional director of disaster risk management is in Conakry to work on containment efforts.
“People are scared. They are rightly scared, but so far, we are not seeing a mass movement of people leaving the area," said Roland Berehoudougou. "The key thing in the area is there is a lack of information. So now we are supporting the government, the minister of health, in providing mass communication - using the TV, local radio and also SMS - to inform people about the situation and also prevention measures they should take to protect themselves against the virus.”
Berehoudougou says schools are of particular concern because children come into such close contact with one another.
The WHO says Ebola is one of the most contagious viral diseases. It is spread through contact with the bodily fluids, such as sweat, blood and saliva, of an infected person or animal.
There is no vaccine or cure. Symptoms usually start with fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhea. Some people experience bleeding through the eyes, ears, nose or mouth.
The most recent outbreaks occurred in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2012. Fifty-seven people died. In 2007, Ebola killed 187 people during an outbreak in the DRC.
The director of the WHO's Disease Prevention and Control Unit in Africa worked on such outbreaks.
“What we did, working with the health workers, we instituted strong infection prevention measures, which included the proper disposal of materials that may be soiled with bodily fluids, proper disposal of the corpse or the body of persons that have died from potentially suspected Ebola cases,” said Dr. Francis Kasolo.
He said the length of time to contain an outbreak can vary, but the sooner you start, the better.
This is the first human Ebola outbreak in Guinea and in West Africa. Kasolo said this made it harder to identify the virus as Ebola. Ebola causes viral hemorrhagic fever, but so do several other illnesses common to the region, including lassa fever.
Kasolo said health workers in Guinea just are not as familiar with the disease.
“Our own thinking is that the alert level amongst the health workers and the community is not as high as, for instance, in Uganda and DRC, where Ebola occurs mostly every second or third year," he said. "So it’s a question of people reporting a suspicious or unusual illness, but because they are not familiar with that, it does take a little while for them to ... finally think of Ebola.”
Aid organizations are now supplying protective gear to health workers, as well as other medical supplies and medications to ease the symptoms of infected people.
Doctors Without Borders has set up isolation units in southern Guinea to treat suspected cases.
The ministries of health in Guinea and Liberia say public information campaigns are underway to educate people about the symptoms of Ebola and the modes of transmission.

Sierra Leone Religious Leaders to Launch Ebola Prayer Campaign
The Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone will launch a seven-day, nationwide fasting, prayer, and education campaign to help the government’s effort in combatting Ebola on Thursday, according to Abdulai Bayraytay, a spokesman for the administration in Freetown.
The religious group, comprised of Muslims and Christians, met Tuesday to come up with a campaign plan following earlier discussions with President Ernest Bai Koroma.
Bayraytay welcomed the plan as a positive development.
“This seven-day fasting period according to the Inter-religious Council is more to provide meditation, the recitation of the Koran and the Holy Bible as well as using this as an effective medium to further communicate to the public on the do’s and don’ts as long as we are in the fight against the spread against the Ebola virus,” he said.
Bayraytay said the campaign will be broadcast on national television and radio stations as well as on social media platforms.
He said the Independent Radio Network, made up of networks owned by private organizations, has also agreed to support the campaign.
“They are quite willing to hook up so that the entire country can benefit from this opportunity…I think that is very key the reason being we want to make sure whatever message is coming from our religious leaders trickles down to the people at the village level so that all of us can be on the same page. Particularly, [since] the fight against the Ebola has so far been built as a collective effort,” Bayraytay said.
The World Health Organization estimates that Ebola has so far killed 7,842 people out of 20,081 confirmed cases.

Obama Calls Home US Ebola Workers
U.S. President Barack Obama is withdrawing most of the American troops sent to West Africa to combat the Ebola epidemic.
The United States deployed 3,000 personnel to set up Ebola treatment units and other infrastructure to fight the virus. Speaking Wednesday in Washington, Obama said because the troops were so effective, all but about 100 will return home by April 30.
He said 1,500 personnel have already returned.
The president said he wants to be clear that despite the troops returning home, the work of fighting Ebola is not done. He said the focus now is bringing the number of cases to zero, because "every case is an ember" that could restart the outbreak.
The U.S. troops remaining in West Africa are expected to work with Liberia's military, regional partners and U.S. civilians to continue fighting Ebola.
The worst Ebola outbreak in world history has killed almost 9,000 people. Cases in the three most affected countries — Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone — have risen in the past two weeks after several weeks of decline.
Obama said nations cannot isolate themselves in the fight against the disease.
"We cannot build moats around our countries," he said. "We should instead make sure everybody has basic health systems."
He said such work is not charity, but is in the best interest of the United States.
The World Health Organization warns that challenges remain in bringing the number of cases down to zero and urged West Africans to maintain the measures used to stop transmission of the virus.

Armed Men Raid Liberia Ebola Quarantine Center
A group of young men armed with clubs, claiming that "there's no Ebola" in Liberia, raided a quarantine center for the deadly disease in Monrovia overnight, prompting about 20 patients infected with the deadly virus to flee, a witness said Sunday.
Liberian officials fear Ebola could soon spread through the capital's largest slum after the looters chased off Ebola patients and took items including blood-stained sheets and mattresses.
"They broke down the door and looted the place. The patients have all gone," said Rebecca Wesseh, who witnessed the attack and whose report was confirmed by residents and the head of Health Workers Association of Liberia, George Williams.
Williams, said the unit housed 29 patients who "had all tested positive for Ebola" and were receiving preliminary treatment before being taken to hospital.
"Of the 29 patients, 17 fled last night (after the assault). Nine died four days ago and three others were yesterday taken by force by their relatives" from the center, he said.
The violence in the West Point slum occurred late Saturday and was led by residents angry that patients were brought from other parts of the capital to the holding center, Tolbert Nyenswah, assistant health minister, said Sunday.
The group also looted equipment and food from the facility, witnesses said.
Liberian police restored order to the West Point neighborhood, which is home to an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 poor Liberians.
Ebola has killed 1,145 people in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization, which added that Liberia has recorded more Ebola deaths - 413 - than any of the other affected countries - Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Guinea.
'Plague villages'
To try to control the Ebola epidemic spreading through West Africa, Liberia has quarantined remote villages at the epicenter of the virus, evoking the "plague villages" of medieval Europe that were shut off from the outside world.
With few food and medical supplies getting in, many abandoned villagers face a stark choice: stay where they are and risk death or skip quarantine, spreading the infection further in a country ill-equipped to cope.
In Boya, in northern Liberia's Lofa County, Joseph Gbembo, who caught Ebola and survived, said he is struggling to raise 10 children under five years of age and support five widows after nine members of his family died from the virus.
He said he has received no food or health care for the children and no help from government officials.
Aid workers said that if support does not arrive soon, locals in villages like Boya, where the undergrowth is already spreading among the houses, will simply disappear down jungle footpaths.
"If sufficient medication, food and water are not in place, the community will force their way out to fetch food and this could lead to further spread of the virus," said Tarnue Karbbar, a worker for charity Plan International based in Lofa County.
In the week ending August 13, Lofa county recorded more new cases of Ebola than anywhere else - 124 new cases of Ebola and 60 deaths.
WHO and Liberian officials have warned that, with little access by health care workers to the remote areas hidden deep in rugged jungle zones, the actual toll may be far higher.
Liberia containment strategy
In Monrovia, which still bears the scars of the brutal 14-year civil war that ended in 2003, officials said controlling the situation in Lofa is crucial to overcoming the country's biggest crisis since the conflict.
With her country under threat, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has imposed emergency measures including the community quarantine and a "cordon sanitaire" - a system of medical roadblocks to prevent the infection reaching cities, widely used against the Black Death in Medieval times.
Troops have been deployed under operation "White Shield" to stop people from abandoning homes and infecting others in a country where the majority of cases remain at large, either because clinics are full or because they are scared of hospitals regarded as "death traps."
Liberia, one of the world's least developed nations, has poor Internet and telecommunications, and only about 50 doctors for a population of more than 4 million.
In Liberia, families continue to hide their sick at home. Health workers and facilities have come under attack.
Traditional funerals, where family members bathe and dress highly contagious corpses, have expedited Ebola's spread to nine of the country's 15 counties.
Neighbors Guinea and Sierra Leone have placed checkpoints in Gueckedou and Kenema, creating a cross-border quarantine zone of roughly 20,000 square kilometers, called the "unified sector."
Within this massive ring are areas where up to 70 percent of people are infected.
"Access to these hot spots is now cut off except for medical workers," Liberia Information Minister Lewis Brown said in an interview this week.
On Saturday, Sirleaf spent the day with education teams in communities around Monrovia, trying to answer people's questions about Ebola and urge them to comply with containment measures. Hundreds of people turned out to listen and to ask questions.

Ebola Survivors Share Their Experiences
KENEMA, SIERRA LEONE —
As the Ebola outbreak continues to spread, there is some hope from those who survive it.
In Kenema, in eastern Sierra Leone, a survivor conference was held for the first time. The goal was to counsel survivors and look at ways they can increase awareness about the disease.
Music blared through a small church as 36 Ebola survivors danced to celebrate the fact that they have beaten the deadly virus, for which there is no vaccine.
The survivor conference was organized by the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs.
Counsel and teach
The ministry and various non-governmental organizations want to encourage the survivors to counsel other Ebola patients and teach people in their communities more about Ebola and prevention.
Matthew Dalling, UNICEF chief of child protection, said survivors often face a social stigma.
“They go back into communities and they are ostracized, and are told to leave. One or two survivors I met are renting [homes] in Kenema city because they cannot go back to their rural villages," Dalling said.
"What we want to do is find a way to get them to go back and become helpers and advocates, champions. We really see them as heroes,” he said.
Nurse Fatmata Feremusu Sesay contracted the disease while tending to a patient who vomited on her. She said because the material of her nursing gown is so light, the vomit managed to get on her skin.
Ebola is only spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person.
Grateful to be alive
Sesay said she is grateful to be alive and that she wants to become an advocate in her community, because some still do not believe Ebola is real.

​“There was a rumor that, they [the government] were giving us [nurses] a huge amount of money and we are the ones killing the people, that we are injecting the people, that we kill the people,” Sesay said.
It is those kinds of rumors that Ebola survivor Dauda Mohamed Fullah also wants to stop.
He works as a lab technician at the Kenema government hospital and has faced rejection from people because he had Ebola.
But Fullah said the hardest part is that most of his family also got infected and did not survive.
“I think about them sometimes. I have nightmares, even last night I had a dream I saw my father and I could not bear it. I wanted to go to him, but he rejected me, said, 'No.' So, I started crying in my dreams and I woke up with tears in my eyes,” Fullah said.
Traumatized
Many survivors have similar harrowing experiences. Jamilah Jawara lost her twin babies to Ebola.
"It was June 17th. I lost my two kids, they were in my hands, the first one died, the boy,” Jawara said. Her daughter died shortly after.
These experiences can traumatize survivors.
World Health Organization spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said the idea of having survivors work in communities and with patients is good, but they need to also make sure they are ready and should not feel obligated.
It is also important to still take all necessary precautions, Harris said.
“For instance, people are talking about survivors being perfectly safe from being infected again, well we have not done antibody levels [tests on them]. We know they have survived, but we do not know they are 100 percent protected, and we have to make sure they are medically safe,” Harris said.
There are 634 survivors in Sierra Leone as of October 19, according to the Ministry of Health and Sanitation.
UNICEF's Dalling said there will be another 13 similar conferences across the country for survivors, and officials hope to start rolling out a more concrete plan as soon as possible.

Ebola Fears Prompts N. Korea to Back Out of Major Taekwondo Events
North Korea has backed out of hosting of two major international taekwondo events this year, citing fears of the deadly Ebola virus, a top official with the sport's governing body said.
The disease, which has ravaged several West African nations and turned up in the United States, Spain and elsewhere, has not showed up in any East Asian nation since the outbreak exploded last summer.
Kim Seung Hwan, secretary general of the International Taekwondo Federation, told VOA’s Korean Service Tuesday that Pyongyang has notified the governing body that it was refusing to host the two events: the 60th Anniversary of Taekwondo even, scheduled for April, and the 19th Taekwondo World Championships in August.
Earlier this week, the president of North Korea’s Taekwondo Committee, Kim Kyong Ho, sent an official letter to the federation expressing “sincere regret” for the decision.
The decision means dozens of participating nations will instead head to Bulgaria for the two events.
North Korea has taken several extraordinary measures in an effort to prevent any infection from entering the country.
For the past three months, all foreigners have been banned from entering the country. That has jeopardized the annual Pyongyang Marathon, scheduled for April 12.
North Korea had previously notified tour operators in the United States and China that it would will allow foreign competitors in for the marathon. But the cancellation of the taekwondo events makes that an open question.
South Korea has taken no similar measures with regards to Ebola.
Taekwondo, a form of competitive martial arts that is included in the Olympics, among other venues, is a hugely popular sport in the two Koreas.

US Opens Ebola Treatment Unit in Liberia
The United States has opened the first of several Ebola treatment units it is building in Liberia.
The new clinic opened Monday in Tubmanburg, about 60 kilometers north of the Liberian capital, Monrovia. A U.S. Agency for International Development statement said up to 17 such units will be constructed in Liberia, including three that will be operated by the International Organization for Migration.
According to the World Health Organization, the number of people infected with Ebola appears to be decreasing in Monrovia, but more cases are being detected in other areas of the West African country.
Since the first case of Ebola was reported in March, more than 2,700 people in Liberia have lost their lives to the deadly virus.
Each of the new units will have 100 beds. The U.S. also will help will train medical workers and burial teams to staff the buildings.
Outbreak far from over
The medical aid group Doctors Without Borders warned the international community on Monday not to become complacent over the decline of new Ebola cases in Liberia. It said the outbreak is “far from over and new hot spots could emerge.”
The group, also known by its french acronym MSF, said, “In Liberia, the international response is finally getting off the ground.”
The group is now calling for rapid response teams to deal with new hot spots and the “restarting” of Liberia’s health care system, which, it said, “has virtually collapsed because on the epidemic.”
Meanwhile, the Sierra Leone government reported a dramatic spike in new cases of Ebola. On Sunday, 111 new cases were registered, according to official figures released by Sierra Leone's ministry of health and sanitation.
The United Nations has warned that cases in Sierra Leone are underreported by as much as 50 percent.
Nico Heijenberg, emergency coordinator for MSF Switzerland, is in the Liberia capital Monrovia. He spoke with VOA’s Joe De Capua.

Experimental Ebola Vaccine Shown to Work During Trial
New studies show that an experimental Ebola vaccine that is being tested on monkeys can work for five weeks, or up to 10 months if used in conjunction with a booster shot.
In a study published Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) said the experimental vaccine regimen produced durable immunity against the deadly virus.
Researchers say a single dose of the vaccine protected all four test monkeys when exposed to Ebola five weeks later. They said half were protected when exposed to the virus 10 months after vaccination.
However, in tests on a separate group of monkeys, scientists say a booster shot, given two months after the initial vaccination, extended protection for all vaccinated monkeys for up to 10 months.
The vaccine tested by the NIH is similar to one being developed by drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.
US military help
U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. military would help in the fight against the Ebola virus, which has killed more than 2,000 people in West Africa.
Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Obama said U.S. military assets are needed to set up isolation units and equipment and provide security for international health workers.
Obama said he believes the United States needs to make dealing with the Ebola outbreak a national security priority.
He warned that it will still take months to control the epidemic and said that if efforts are not made now the outbreak could spread across Africa and around the world.
Ebola lockdown
Meanwhile, authorities in Sierra Leone are ordering people to stay at home for three days this month as part of an effort to stop the spread of the Ebola virus.
Humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders has criticized the measure, saying it could lead to people trying to conceal infections.
Experts have repeatedly said that quarantines and border closures do not help control Ebola. They recommend screening and immediate treatment for suspected patients.
A Sierra Leone government spokesman said Saturday people will not be allowed to leave their homes from late September 18 till September 21.
A lockdown last month in an area of Monrovia, Liberia, sparked riots.
Ebola has ravaged Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since March.

WHO: Ebola Unlikely to Spread on Airplanes
GENEVA —
The World Health Organization says it does not recommend a ban on air travel to and from Ebola affected countries in West Africa. The U.N. health agency says the risk of spread of the deadly disease in an airplane is extremely low.
Korean Air announced Thursday it would suspend air travel to Kenya as of August 20 as a measure to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus. The first airline to take similar action was the Dubai carrier Emirates, which suspended air travel to Guinea on August 2.
The World Health Organization does not endorse a ban on travel or trade. It says air travel even from Ebola affected countries poses an extremely low risk of transmission of the disease.
WHO Director of Alert and Response, Isabelle Nuttal, said Ebola was not airborne like Influenza or tuberculosis. She said the Ebola infection was passed on only through direct contact with a sick person's body fluid, such as blood, vomit, sweat or diarrhea.
"On the small chance that someone is sick on a plane, the likelihood of other passengers and crew contact with their body fluids is even smaller," she said. "A person infected with Ebola…this person can transmit the disease to another one only if he or she has the symptom of a disease - fever, vomiting, diarrhea. A person that has no sign of the disease is not contagious, is not transmitting the disease to others."
Nuttal said usually people, who are sick with Ebola, felt so unwell they could not travel. Therefore, she said WHO was advising against travel bans to and from affected countries.
West Africa is in the grips of the worst Ebola epidemic on record. More than 1,800 people are infected with the disease and more than 1,000 have died, most in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Nigeria reports nine cases and two deaths. One person who died flew to Lagos from Monrovia, Liberia.
But, that person was allowed on the plane before WHO declared Ebola an International Public Health Emergency. Nuttal said WHO recommended that airlines screen passengers going to or coming from Ebola-affected countries before allowing them to board the plane.
"They need to be able and prepared to detect, investigate, as they would do, generally speaking all year long any disease that may occur. This is the purpose of international health regulations - ensure that all countries do have the capacity to detect any event, that is something serious, severe…and able to immediately provide adequate treatment for that person," she said.
If someone was confirmed to have Ebola, she said that person would have to be isolated.
The World Health Organization says the perceived risk of catching Ebola is quite different from the real risk, which is very low. It says countries should carefully balance these risks before considering a travel ban. It says such bans have a bad economic impact on the travel and trade of targeted countries and are unwarranted.

Health Ministers: Ebola Outbreak in West Africa Needs Stronger Response
LONDON —
Health ministers from across West Africa are attending an emergency conference in Ghana to discuss the regional outbreak of Ebola virus disease. The World Health Organization says the highly infectious disease has killed more than 400 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In Sierra Leone police and medical workers man checkpoints on the outskirts of Kenema -- the site of an Ebola outbreak that is spreading across West Africa.
Authorities are forcing people to test for the disease. Some victims try to avoid detection, preferring to die in secret.
The outbreak is the worst since the disease was identified in the 1970s, according to Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
"The outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented in the history of Ebola outbreaks because it involves three countries, at least, capital cities, multiple sources, and that will make it far more difficult to control," he said.
Ebola causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea. It is spread through contact with the blood or other fluids of infected people.
Misinformation, porous borders
Doctors say a lack of understanding is contributing to its rapid spread. Porous borders between the affected countries also make it difficult to contain.
Dr. Shek Moar Khan of Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone said families often bury victims without telling anyone.
“By the time people are dead with the Ebola, they are more infectious than ever. So if they take care of their burial on their own, 10 more will be infected,” said Khan.
In neighboring Liberia, nurse Elizabeth Smith lies bleeding on a hospital bed. She contracted the Ebola virus from her patients. Her colleagues are doing what they can to help; but her chances of survival are about 10 percent.
Sense of urgency
District health officer Philip Azumah said Liberia cannot cope alone.
“We are calling on the international community to come and support the ministry. Right now we can't do it. We need international support,” he said.
But it’s not just medical help that’s needed. Communities across the region need urgent education about the disease, said Piot.
“Fear of the virus and distrust of authorities and of the health system probably is as bad and as dangerous as the virus itself," he said. "And what I think is needed now is a massive information campaign, but not just facts, but involving community leaders, the media, the local media, more than disease experts.”
Health workers bury the dead in unmarked graves in the middle of the bush. The disease is so infectious that disinfectant is sprayed every step of the way. The workers’ protective clothing is buried along with the body.
The death toll from the outbreak is growing. Doctors warn that the response to date has been far from adequate.

WHO Tells Liberia to Increase Hospital Beds for Ebola Patients
DAKAR —
The World Health Organization said Ebola treatment centers in and around Monrovia need to triple their capacity to 1,000 beds, because as more people become ill and they seek treatment, clinics are having to turn some patients away.
Ebola treatment units in Monrovia are filled to overflowing. Each is only able to take in a trickle of new patients as beds become free.
The ELWA-3 clinic is no exception.
A VOA reporter outside the clinic saw a woman vomiting in the back of a taxi Tuesday morning as her sister, wearing gloves, held her. The taxi driver had run away, abandoning the vehicle.
Three other cars parked nearby each had a sick person sprawled in the back seat.
Resident Jerry Dope said he had been driving since sunrise, trying to find health care for his nephew, who was ill. The ELWA-3 clinic is the third care center they had visited.
“I brought my nephew. He has been sick. His skin is hot with fever. We brought him here this morning, but we are told there is no space in there, so we are confused," said Dope. "We don’t know where to go. We don’t know where to head right now.”
Not enough hospital beds
A guard at the clinic said it has been like this for the past three weeks.
“We see sometimes three, four cars coming in front of the gate and then sometimes only one will be [attended] to, and the rest remain there until they are dead," the guard said.
The ELWA-3 clinic, run by Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders [MSF], is the largest in Monrovia. They are in the process of expanding from 120 beds to 400 beds.
Crews are working around the clock to get a new government-run treatment unit, with 100 beds, open later this week in Monrovia.
But the World Health Organization said that is not enough. The caseload is exploding in Montserrado County, which contains the capital.
The WHO said 1,000 beds are needed and that hundreds of health workers must also be trained to staff the new treatment units.
WHO spokesman Tarik Jasaveric said, "All these [sick] people who are outside may potentially infect other people, so this is why we are saying it is really urgent to step up the response.”
Public health experts said survival chances are better for those patients who get supportive medical care soon after symptoms start.
Liberia crisis
Liberia’s defense minister told the U.N. Security Council Tuesday the Ebola virus has become a health emergency surpassing his government’s capacity to respond.
Liberia is the hardest hit of the West African countries affected by the ongoing outbreak of the disease. Nine of the country’s 15 counties are currently affected and the Ministry of Health has put the number of reported cases above 2,000 with over 1,000 deaths.
Meanwhile, the death toll from the West African Ebola outbreak has climbed to 2,296 - an increase of 200 in just four days.
The World Health Organization's latest update on the crisis, released Tuesday, says a total of nearly 4,300 cases of Ebola have been reported across five West African countries.
Just under half of all reported cases and deaths come from Liberia. A WHO report on Liberia, released Monday, warned the number of new cases there is "increasing exponentially" and said thousands of new patients can be expected over the next three weeks.
The WHO says "intense transmission" of the disease also continues in Guinea and Sierra Leone
Liberia’s Defense Minister Brownie Samukai told the Security Council that Ebola is affecting every sector of society.
“We are meeting at a time when Liberia is facing a serious threat to its national existence. The deadly Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the normal functioning of our state,” said Samukai.
He said the government has taken emergency steps to limit the spread of the disease including declaring a 90-day state of emergency, putting non-essential government employees on leave, quarantining severely affected communities and imposing a nationwide curfew.
“In spite of all these measures, continued denial, traditional practices, religious rituals, fear and community resistance still constitute obstacles to progress,” said Samukai.
Minister Samukai said the country lacks the infrastructure, logistical capacity, professional expertise and financial resources to effectively combat Ebola and he welcomed U.N. and international assistance.
The top U.N. diplomat in Liberia, Karin Landgren, said the spread of the disease has been “merciless."
“The speed and scale of loss of lives, and the economic, social, political and security reverberations of the crisis, are affecting Liberia profoundly," said Landgren.
Landgren warned there is a potential for instability as the health system struggles, the economy suffers, food shortages spread and political processes, such as planned senate elections for October, become delayed.
She said the country, which had the weakest health system in the region before the crisis, is overwhelmed, with a shortage of medical workers and beds in treatment centers. At least 160 health workers have been infected, and about 80 have died from the virus with its hemorrhagic fever-like symptoms.
Landgren said the U.N. Mission in Liberia is focused completely on combating Ebola and offered significant logistical support to the government response.
The United Nations says Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is planning to convene a high-level event on the sidelines of the General Assembly annual debate later this month to highlight the needs and required response to Ebola from the private and public sectors.
Refining the health message
Meanwhile, the importance of local efforts to spread messages about Ebola were emphasized during a two-day forum that wrapped up Tuesday in Dakar.
West African health authorities were meeting to figure out how to better communicate with people affected by Ebola.
Their common message: Local leaders need to be patients' allies.
The conference was organized by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Africa zone director Alasan Senghore said the solution is to involve local communities more in outreach, to talk with people, instead of at them.
“People don’t understand and when they don’t understand they are bound to create problems even for those who are trying to help them," said Senghore.
Dr. Mariane Ngoulla, health adviser for the Economic Community of West African States, said the effort needs a cooperative approach.
“If we approach them and say, ‘We have something to share with you. How do we do it?’ they will tell us. They will listen, and we will change what needs to be changed.”
'Women-to-women communication'
Women account for more than half of Ebola deaths in this outbreak. Public health experts said early interventions did not focus enough on women.
Now Grev Hunt, sub-regional coordinator on Ebola for the U.N. Children’s Emergency Relief Fund, said that is changing.
“We are using women-to-women communication," said Hunt. "In addition, we are developing materials for our illiterate populations and the preferred method is going door to door.
"One woman talking to another woman on how she can protect her loved ones. So she is using her heart and her hands to keep her loved ones safe," Hunt added.
However, Hunt said the message also must evolve with reality.
'Treat at home'
In the early days of the outbreak, much of the communication work was focused on getting people to accept that “Ebola is real” and to seek treatment.
Now, Hunt said, with treatment centers are at capacity and many health workers are refusing to come to work.
"We’re saying treat at home because there is not the capacity, there aren’t enough beds in the treatment centers," Hunt said. "It’s morally difficult for us to say. But what we’re teaching them is how to keep their hands protected, how to rehydrate the patient. We’re trying to institute intermediary measures."

British Govt. Criticized Over ‘Indecisive’ Policy on Ebola
LONDON —
With a large West African diaspora population - and tens of thousands of travelers passing through its airports every day - health professionals say it’s highly likely that Britain will soon see cases of Ebola. But there’s been criticism of the British government’s response to the crisis, with policy U-turns and conflicting advice.
British authorities staged an eight-hour nationwide drill Saturday to simulate an Ebola case arriving in the country, designed to test the health system and government response.
Britain’s Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced in Parliament Monday that screenings would be introduced for passengers arriving from the worst-hit countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
“This will allow potential Ebola virus carriers arriving in the UK to be identified, tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice should they develop symptoms," said Hunt.
Some medical experts dispute the effectiveness of screening. Professor Tom Solomon is director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool.
“This is a disease which has an incubation period up to 21 days. So if people have symptoms when they leave a country in West Africa that would be picked up, and there's very little to be gained additionally from screening people again, 10 hours later when they arrive in the UK," said Solomon.
Britain said last week it would not introduce screening, but then reversed the policy. Sophie Harman of Queen Mary University of London described the government response as reactionary and haphazard.
“If a case of Ebola does come to the UK, and increasingly we think that is going to happen, we do have a robust health system to deal with this issue. And I think that was an important message that the government has slightly lost by introducing these border restrictions, which are quite facile at best," said Harman.
Doctor Stephen Mepham of Royal Free Hospital in London - which houses the country’s only high-level isolation unit - says there is no need for the British public to worry.
“Britain has a very different environment to West Africa. It's inconceivable to think that the virus could travel in the same way as it has in health care settings in West Africa," said Mepham.
Workers for Britain’s National Health Service staged a 4-hour strike Monday over pay. Christina McAnea of UNISON, the public workers’ union, says government cuts could undermine the airport screening program.
“Due to cuts in NHS funding that the health staff who work at airports are actually being cut, and it's our understanding that almost three-quarters of them have been cut at Heathrow [airport]," said McAnea.
The government insists the country is well-prepared. Health professionals say it is very likely the disease will soon arrive in Britain.

Obama Urges Congress to Approve Emergency Ebola Funding
President Barack Obama is urging U.S. lawmakers, before they leave for the holiday recess in a few weeks, to pass $6.2 billion in emergency funding to fight the Ebola virus and prepare U.S. hospitals to handle future cases.
Speaking Tuesday at the National Institutes of Health near Washington, Obama said money to battle the disease is running out. He said Congress could give a Christmas present to the American people and the world by passing a spending bill.
He called it "exciting news" that a potential Ebola vaccine produced no serious side effects during the first phase of clinical testing. He noted that no other potential Ebola drug had progressed this far to date.
However, Obama stressed that there was no guarantee the vaccine would work and that the fight was not close to being over, even if media attention had shifted to other issues.
Most of Obama's request is aimed at the immediate response to the disease at home and abroad. But the package also includes $1.5 billion in contingency funds — money that could become a target if lawmakers decided to trim the bill.
"That is the part of the package that is most at risk,'' said Sam Worthington, president of InterAction, an alliance of U.S. nongovernmental aid groups.
While lawmakers recognize that the United States has to take action to arrest the deadly disease, some are wary of giving the administration leeway in investing money in public health systems in West Africa.
"I think there is less understanding of the need to stay in it for the long run and to build the capacity of countries to ensure this doesn't happen in the future,'' Worthington said.
Ebola has killed about 6,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, along with a handful of people in other countries.
The Obama administration came under fire in September after a series of missteps with a man who traveled to Dallas from Liberia and later died of Ebola. Two nurses contracted the disease while caring for the man.
Screening and treatment procedures have since been tightened. There are no current U.S. cases, and stories about the outbreak have faded from headlines.
"My hope is that we're not getting Ebola fatigue setting in,'' said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, a Christian missionary group that helps treat Ebola patients in Liberia. "There continues to be a huge need for this funding.''

Ebola Fears Cloud Jehovah's Witnesses Meeting in Zimbabwe
HARARE —
Zimbabwe's government is in a quandary as the country prepares to host a three-day Jehovah's Witnesses conference with 50,000 people from around the world expected to attend. Some delegates will come from West Africa, where there has been an outbreak of Ebola. Given the state of the host’s health care system, however, some delegates might be barred from attending.
Dr. Christopher Tapfumaneyi, the principal director in Zimbabwe’s health ministry, says the country has not had an Ebola case, but that the government is aware of problems that the conference might present. Tapfumaneyi says with the advice of the World Health Organization, Zimbabwe has started educating some medical officials about Ebola.
“They are going to ensure that if there is a visitor coming into the country who in the past three weeks has been in the three countries that have been targeted, they will look at the person closely. If there is reason to isolate that person, that isolation will be done. The centers have already been prepared for that," he said.
The Zimbabwean official is referring to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and that Zimbabwe is not taking chances. The government has since recalled all its soldiers on the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia following the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.
The World Health Organization head in Zimbabwe, Dr. David Okello, says the southern African nation must not panic.
“The likelihood of Ebola coming here is remote," he said. "The risk is low, but we live in a global village. Somebody could be infected with Ebola in Liberia, flies to South Africa and is here the next day. I think my main worry is we are now dealing with, not an epidemic of Ebola here, but an epidemic of fear and panic."
Zimbabwe's health care system has been near collapse for more than a decade.
Earlier this week, the African Union said the continent’s ministers of health would meet in September to lobby their countries to replenish the AU's Special Emergency Fund for Drought and Famine, which will also now cover public health.
The AU said the Ebola outbreak provides an impetus to speed up the establishment of the African Center for Disease Control and Prevention for early detection, preparedness and response. An early detection center is what all Jehovah's Witnesses coming to Zimbabwe will experience.
If they have been to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, they might not attend the conference, but Effort Mugabe, the coordinator of the Jehovah's Witnesses conference, is convinced all will go well.
“We are not very much concerned, because very shortly the government assured that they are in total control of it. We do hope that with the help of the government, we will be happy to do it without any problems at all," he said.
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is probably the deadliest in history and led health ministers from southern Africa to meet in South Africa last week. They asked World Health Organization officials to provide for the control of the international spread of disease across borders.

Ebola Grips West Africa
Liberia's president is reassuring the country's healthcare workers that more resources for the battle against Ebola are on the way.
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf met with healthcare workers Saturday in Monrovia. The workers were demanding more pay and better working conditions.
The president promised a quick response to the pay grievance, but asked for patience with other demands, including for more ambulances.
Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have together lost nearly 1,000 lives to Ebola. Guinea announced Saturday it was closing its borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone.
One of the most recent fatalities was a Congolese nun, who contracted Ebola while working with Spanish Catholic missionaries in Liberia.
There have also been at least two Ebola deaths in Nigeria, which along with the other three countries, has declared a state of emergency to authorize additional funds to address the crisis.
The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is on pace to infect more people than all previous outbreaks of the virus combined. The disease has no known cure or vaccine.
In response to the outbreak, the World Health Organization has declared the epidemic an international health emergency.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has activated its emergency operation center at the highest level. CDC chief Dr. Thomas Frieden said his agency would soon have 50 disease experts in West Africa, and that he was confident the virus would not result in any major outbreak in the United States.
The World Health Organization Friday reported the number of Ebola cases in the four West African countries affected stands at 1,779, and that 961 of those people have already died.
WHO director Dr. Margaret Chan said the four nations "do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity," and appealed for greater international aid.
Ebola patients may experience fever, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches and uncontrollable bleeding from all openings in the body, including the eyes, mouth and ears. Initial symptoms are often similar to malaria.

Obama: Ebola Still a Danger
WHITE HOUSE —
President Barack Obama says there has been “great progress” in the fight against Ebola in West Africa, but warns the international community must stay vigilant until the virus is wiped out.
Obama on Wednesday met with the leaders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the nations most devastated by last year's outbreak, to assess the progress and talk about recovery efforts.
The strides those countries have made, with help from the United States, is evident. After killing 10,000 people in the region, the Ebola epidemic is down to fewer than 40 new cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Liberia has no registered new cases.
Obama hosted Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President Alpha Condé of Guinea, and President Ernest Bai Koroma in the White House Cabinet Room. He praised what he said was their great courage and resolve in treating victims.
“Now, we’re focused on a shared goal and that is getting to zero,” he said, adding “We can’t be complacent. This virus is unpredictable.”
Obama called for vigilance, saying the international community has to remain fully engaged in a partnership with the three countries “until there are no cases of Ebola.”
In addition to killing thousands, Ebola damaged the economies of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and their leaders are asking for help to rebuild. They also want help to strengthen their health systems to deal with future threats.
Obama said the U.S. wants to provide that help.
The West African leaders, during their visit to Washington, also had meetings scheduled at multi-lateral organizations including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The U.S. last year sent thousands of troops to West Africa to set up medical facilities in the region, train medical personnel, and coordinate an international response to the epidemic.
This week, Secretary of State John Kerry and the African Union representative signed a agreement for the creation of an African Centers for Disease Control. The U.S. is to provide technical advisers and fellowships for the institute, which is expected to launch later this year.
As a sign the epidemic is still cause for concern, Guinea this week closed its border with Sierra Leone to prevent a further spread of the disease. Guinean officials say President Condé ordered emergency measures, including the border closures, to be reinforced for 45 days in five districts.

Guinea Finds 9 New Ebola Cases Near Sierra Leone Border
CONAKRY, GUINEA —
Guinean authorities have confirmed at least nine new cases of Ebola in the southwest region of Forecariah near the border with Sierra Leone, the area hardest hit by the year-old outbreak, a senior health official said Thursday.
Authorities launched a four-day, door-to-door campaign in Forecariah on Sunday to try to improve community participation in reporting suspected cases and as part of an emergency 45-day drive to tackle Ebola in the west of the country.
Sakoba Keita, national coordinator for the fight against Ebola in the West African country, said authorities had also detected 10 suspicious deaths in the community but only one of these had been confirmed as Ebola.
Keita said 92 percent of households in Forecariah had been reached in the four-day program.
"We have been able to find nine sick people [with Ebola] hiding in Forecariah,'' Keita said at a news conference. "That discovery will allow us at least to stop the development of new chains of infection.''
The Ebola epidemic, which started deep in the forests of southeastern Guinea in December 2013, is believed to have killed more than 10,600 people and infected 25,791 in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. In its latest weekly report Wednesday, the WHO said 37 confirmed cases had been reported in the week that ended Sunday, up from 30 the previous week. Of those, 28 were recorded in Guinea and the rest were in Sierra Leone.
The outbreak in Guinea is concentrated in the western area around the coastal capital, Conakry. Forecariah lies on the main road south from Conakry to the border with Sierra Leone.
The WHO said 17 confirmed Ebola cases had been detected in Forecariah in the week that ended Sunday. Keita said that community's reluctance to curb traditional burial practices, which involve touching the dead, was the principal reason for the continued spread of the infectious virus.

West African Immigrants Worry About Family, Friends as Ebola Spreads
NEW YORK —
The deadly Ebola virus in West Africa has taken the lives of more than 1,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. In New York City, many Africans worry about their relatives and friends as the unprecedented outbreak sweeps through the region a continent away.
Haunting scenes of Ebola victims in West Africa are a common sight on television news. But for many West African immigrants living in New York City, the deadly outbreak is personal.
New York City is home to more than 70,000 people born in Western Africa. Many hail from countries hardest hit by Ebola, including Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Many still have family and friends in those nations.
Like Leo Fraser, whose aunt who lives in Sierra Leone.
“Right now the family is figuring out how to get her more supplies, so she won't have to leave the home. You know, because the more she interacts with the general population the more she is at risk for contracting Ebola," said Fraser.
Ebola has no known cure. And the current West African outbreak is on pace to infect more people than all the previous outbreaks combined.
This is worrisome news in the Bronx, where half of the city’s West African population lives. Imam Mohamadou Soukona, leads his community, or jama’ah, in prayers and collects donations for the sick.
“The community in the jama’ah will make a doa to pray for the people who are infected with this disease," said Soukona.
The mosque’s public relations manager, Bakary Camara:
“As individuals here in this community, we warn our members to be careful of anyone that they think might come from these areas and advise them to make sure that they look and take doctors' advice - not to have bodily contact that will in a sense contract the disease," said Camara.
West African residents expressed hope the global effort to contain the disease will work, but also frustration they could not do more to help.

Kenya Announces Border, Flight Restrictions to Prevent Ebola
Kenya has closed its borders to travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the country’s health ministry said Saturday, an indication of growing fears about the Ebola outbreak afflicting growing regions of West Africa.
The decision was based on information from the World Health Organization, which earlier said the magnitude of the outbreak had been "vastly underestimated" and could continue for some time.
In a statement, the Kenyan health ministry said the travel ban affected all ports of entry but would not include health care professionals trying to fight the spread of the virus.
Kenya Airways on Saturday suspended all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone, joining other airlines that have announced flight restrictions in West Africa.
On Thursday, Korean Air Lines said it was suspending flights to the Kenyan capital Nairobi, in what it called a measure to stop Ebola from spreading.
No cases have been reported in Kenya, but the WHO has classified the East African country as a high-risk area for the disease because it is a major transport hub.
British Airways and Emirates airlines have also suspended services to parts of West Africa.
The world health body said Friday the number of people who had died from Ebola had risen to 1,145 and the overall number of cases had topped 2,100. The virus has been confirmed in four countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.
Nigerian officials said they had trained 800 health workers and volunteers to help in the fight.
In Liberia, officials announced plans to expand treatment centers in the capital Monrovia. They said an existing center has become overcrowded.
There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, though a WHO panel this week backed plans to give some patients unproven drugs to fight the virus.
The head of the international Red Cross organization said Friday that outbreak has stretched the capacities of the group's relief partners "to the maximum." Elhadj As Sy also warned that time was of the essence to stop the spread of the disease.
More than 1,500 Red Cross volunteers are now working in Ebola-affected communities, he said.
"Expertise is a resource. Experience of having worked in an Ebola setting is a resource. Bringing your own knowledge of the environment and the cultural setting is a resource,” he said. “And, of course, we badly need the financial resources and the infrastructure and the equipment that will allow us to cope and then continue to support the response.”

Sierra Leone Religious Leaders Criticize Government Handling of Ebola
FREETOWN —
Religious leaders in Sierra Leone have criticized the government's handling of an Ebola outbreak that has killed 194 people in the West Africa country, saying a lack of information was prompting rural communities to shun medical help.
Health authorities in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are struggling to contain the worst outbreak of the deadly epidemic which has killed some 603 people since early this year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Bishop John Yambasu, chairman of an interfaith task force, said he was “seriously disappointed” the government had failed to declare a public health emergency and pump more resources into the fight against Ebola, which has infected 400 people in the country.
The highest number of deaths in recent weeks had been recorded in Sierra Leone, the WHO said. It warned of resistance from remote rural communities to allowing access to doctors amid fears that outsiders were spreading the disease.
“Every day in this country the number of new cases is increasing. To us as religious leaders that is unacceptable,” Yambasu, head of the United Methodist Church of Sierra Leone, told Reuters. He said the government was too concerned by the “political connotations” of declaring an emergency.
Health Minister Miatta Kargbo has said the Ebola outbreak is “a serious matter” but has not reached emergency levels.
Ebola causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea and was first detected in Democratic Republic of Congo in the mid-1970s. Spread through contact with blood and bodily fluids, it is one of the deadliest viruses, killing up to 90 percent of those infected, and has no known cure.
Nurses strike
Dozens of nurses at a government hospital in eastern Sierra Leone town of Kenema went on an indefinite strike on Monday following the death of three of their colleagues on Sunday. All three were suspected to have been infected with the deathly virus.
The Kenema hospital has the only testing center in the country for the haemorrhagic fever and holds the highest number of patients of the outbreak.
Mohamed Sheriff, a spokesman for the nurses, said they were demanding among other things the “immediate relocation to an isolated area of the Ebola ward and its takeover by the French medical agency, MSF”.
The Ebola wards are situated inside the Kenema hospital compound which the striking workers say poses a health risk to them and non-Ebola patients.
Sierra Leone's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Brima Kargbo said the government was looking into the nurses' grievances.
Dozens of laboratory technicians at Sierra Leone's only Ebola-testing facility went on strike last week over a $20 monthly risk premium which they were promised but never paid.
Yambasu said that in Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone - the epicenter of the outbreak - locals had dug trenches to bar ambulances and police from accessing their communities. Many locals regard being taken to an isolation ward as a death sentence.
“It is likely that people are dying in the bush” due to lack of information about the disease, he said, adding that leaving those infected in their communities was encouraging the virus to spread.
Yambasu said religious leaders would preach in their churches and mosques for a change of attitude towards the disease and would visit the center of the outbreak and call for change.
Sierra Leone's religious leaders played a leading role in ending a brutal 1991-2002 civil war.
“It is as a result of our experiences of the past that we have invited ourselves into this Ebola struggle,” he said.

WHO: Ebola Death Toll Passes 7,500
The World Health Organization says the death toll from the Ebola outbreak has risen to more than 7,500 people and the number of cases is nearing 20,000.
The latest data, posted Friday, reflects recent trends with Liberia and Guinea seeing a decrease in the rate of Ebola transmissions, while Sierra Leone's cases continue to rise. Those three West African countries account for almost all the Ebola deaths.
The death toll in other countries remains the same with six deaths in Mali, eight in Nigeria, and one in the United States. Spain and Senegal have both had one case each, but no deaths.
Also Friday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the international community needed to better prepare for the next global outbreak of disease, which he said was "a test that is sure to come."'
Ban recently returned from visiting the West African countries hit hardest by Ebola. He said the world must learn the lessons from this outbreak, which he said go beyond strengthening public health systems.
"The international community needs better early warning and rapid response. I intend to engage member states in a serious effort to explore what more we can do to stay ahead of the next outbreak of disease -- a test that is sure to come," he said.
The secretary-general said his presence at the United Nations should send an important message that people without signs of Ebola infection should not be shunned.
"People who have travelled to Ebola-affected countries and have no signs of infection, are no threat. I also repeat my call to avoid travel restrictions, border closures and other counter-productive obstacles. As we fight the Ebola virus, it is equally crucial to combat the contagion of fear," said Ban.

Sierra Leone Records Sharp Drop in Ebola Cases
Sierra Leone recorded only three new confirmed Ebola cases Tuesday. That is a sign that the sustained effort to fight the disease is succeeding, says government spokesman Abdulai Bayraytay.
“We are very much encouraged by the confirmed cases particularly Tuesday whereby we recorded three confirmed cases for the entire country. So that is giving us a glimmer of hope, but it a hope whereby we continue to remind the public that we shouldn’t be complacent at all. That even though we have recorded only three cases, we don’t want people to think it is over.”
“We must improve our surveillance system and above all our social mobilization, which no other person but the president has been leading throughout the length and breadth of this country,” he added.
Bayraytay’s comments came as President Barack Obama was announcing the withdrawal by April 30 of most of the U.S. troops sent to help fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
The Sierra Leonean official said a meeting Monday between President Ernest Bai Koroma and Guinea’s President Alpha Conde in the capital, Freetown, marked a joint effort to respond to the challenges Ebola poses in neighboring countries. President Conde is currently head of the Mano River Union.
The three countries currently battling Ebola are Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
“He was here in an official one day visit to see how Guinea can collaborate further with not only Sierra Leone but also Liberia so that we can promote regional effort in the fight against the virus. Recognizing that we share common cultures, we share common borders with a lot of illegal crossing points among the three countries,” said Bayraytay.
Sierra Leone closed schools across the country following the Ebola outbreak as part of an effort to contain the disease.
Bayraytay says schools will re-open March 30.
He said Sierra Leone’s president had appointed former education minister Christiana Thorpe to coordinate efforts with international development partners and the education ministry in readiness to reopen the schools.
“So far part of the modalities that we are putting in place include among others that all schools are going to re-open on 30th of March and all schools would have been fumigated and decontaminated, particularly those that were used as holding and treatment centers,” said Bayraytay.

US Sets New Protocols for Ebola Health Workers
The United States is tightening its guidelines for health workers treating patients with the Ebola virus, calling for new competency training, a buddy system for donning and doffing personal protective equipment, and total coverage of eyes, hair and skin.
Stricter protocols, expected to be issued Monday evening, build on earlier guidance from the World Health Organization. That international organization urged health workers to wear masks but did not require complete coverage of skin.
The developments come in the wake of at least three reported cases of Ebola in the United States. The virus has plagued West Africa, especially the countries countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, infecting more than 9,200 and killing more than 4,500.
News of new protocols comes on the same day that the WHO declared Nigeria free of the virus, after going 42 days with no new reported Ebola infections. It has had 20 cases.
WHO representative Rui Gama on Monday said Nigeria's development is a "spectacular success story."
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan issued a statement Monday praising Nigerians who worked to contain the disease, but also directed that all anti-Ebola measures remain in effect, including health screenings for people entering the country.
Nigerian health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu attributed the country's success to strong leadership and coordination.
"Under a single leadership, all the contributing partners were molded into a single, almost homogeneous team. This is one factor that we believe may be lacking in the control efforts of other countries," Chukwu said.
Chukwu added that Nigeria may have won its battle, but the global war on Ebola is not over.
Nigeria reported 20 cases of Ebola and eight deaths as part of the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola, which has killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa.
Last week, the WHO also declared Senegal Ebola-free.
Separately, a United Nations spokesman said a staff member from U.N. Women in Sierra Leone died of Ebola in recent days, and the victim's spouse is getting treatment.
Meanwhile, in the southwestern U.S. city of Dallas, Texas, officials announced Monday that the 21-day quarantine had been lifted on 43 people who had contact with the state's first Ebola patient, Liberian native Thomas Eric Duncan.
But Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said 120 other people are being watched for signs of the virus after having contact with one of the two nurses infected while caring for Duncan.
Also in the United States, health workers at a special Ebola treatment unit in the eastern city of Atlanta, Georgia, said another patient has recovered from the virus. The unidentified man was infected with Ebola while in Sierra Leone and was airlifted to Atlanta.
State Department sends personnel
The U.S. State Department said Monday it has 617 personnel in the Ebola-affected capitals of Monrovia, Liberia, and Dakar, Senegal, with plans to send 80 more people by Wednesday to aid with the crisis.
In another development Monday, Cuban leader Raul Castro urged Latin American leaders at a summit in Havana to work together to fight Ebola. He said Cuba was willing to work with the United States on that effort.
"We believe that any politicization of this grave problem should be avoided," Castro said. "It diverts us from the fundamental objective, which is the help to face this epidemic in Africa and prevention in other regions."
In Luxembourg Monday, European Union officials met to discuss the effort to collect $1.2 billion to aid the West African fight against Ebola. In a statement, EU High Representative Catherine Ashton said European officials are considering naming a person to coordinate anti-Ebola efforts between the European Union, member states and the United Nations.
Separately, a United Nations spokesman said a staff member from U.N. Women in Sierra Leone died of Ebola in recent days. It was the third such reported death of a U.N. worker.
Quicker response
Meanwhile, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf called for long-term investment in the health care infrastructure in order to prevent a repeat of the outbreak.
In a Washington Post op-ed, Sirleaf said the international reaction was slow, allowing Ebola to spread in a way that overwhelmed her country's health system.
She said the steps being taken now, such as U.S. soldiers helping set up treatment centers, would not be needed if the health care system were able to quickly and effectively respond at the beginning stages of an outbreak.
Sirleaf cited Uganda as an example where training and resources have enabled doctors to "recognize symptoms and isolate patients immediately" and also be protected themselves.
She said examining ways to prevent future outbreaks is the way to "properly honor" those who have died.
Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit by the outbreak, with more than 9,100 cases of Ebola.
The outbreak has spread to areas outside of West Africa, including Spain, where authorities say a nurse who contracted Ebola while caring for two infected priests now appears to be free of the disease, and in the United States, which has reported three cases of Ebola.
In Luxembourg Monday, European Union officials met to discuss the effort to collect $1.2 billion to aid the West African fight against Ebola.
In a statement, EU High Representative Catherine Ashton said European officials are considering naming a person to coordinate anti-Ebola efforts between the European Union, member states, and the United Nations.
And the U.S. State Department said it has 617 personnel in the Ebola-affected capitals of Monrovia and Dakar, with plans to send 80 more people by October 22 to aid with the crisis.
Guinea blames drivers for Ebola spike
Elsewhere, Guinean authorities blamed a spike in new Ebola cases at least in part on taxi and motorcycle drivers in Coyah, just 50 kilometers from Guinea's capital, Conakry.
Officials accused the drivers of going through the border town of Forecariah to bring in sick people from neighboring Sierra Leone.
The government also said the drivers transport sick people wanting to escape detection by medical personnel out of fear of dying in treatment centers.
Ibrahim Summah, the head of the drivers’ union in Coyah, said that is not true.
Summah told VOA the drivers have been at the forefront in the fight against Ebola from the beginning of the outbreak.
He said no drivers have been caught transporting an Ebola patient and, in fact, they refuse any passenger who refuses to wash with detergent before getting into the vehicle.
More suspicion has fallen on motorcycle drivers because it is easier for them to cross the border. But Abubakar Sylla, head of the motorcycle drivers union, said that is unfair.
Sylla said motorcycle drivers take proper passengers to their destination, and while they do transport some people to the hospital, they do not to take them across the border.
He said his drivers also ask passengers to use precautions - including washing with detergent and disinfectants.
More than 800 people have died of Ebola in Guinea since the outbreak began late last year. There are more than 1,000 confirmed cases now - with three new towns reporting their first cases.
Karim Camara contributed to this report from Coyah, Guinea.

Analysts: Funding, Coordination May Affect Fight Against Ebola
This month, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a global public health emergency. Many international and national organizations are working to get supplies to medical teams in the field.
The international effort and the challenges facing the region were topics of discussion earlier this month at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
Health officials say with Ebola’s emergency designation, there will be a push to develop drugs to thwart the virus and to strengthen weakened national health care systems to identify, quarantine, and treat the infected.
Needed urgently are medical technicians, nurses, doctors, epidemiologists and trained health care workers.
The U.S. government is deploying a number of agencies, including the Department of State, The Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Department of Defense. They are assisting with communications, supplies, and technical and medical expertise.
The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) has spent $14 million in response efforts including the activation of a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART). It will coordinate planning, logistics and other areas of the interagency response.
Some health care experts are concerned about the management and coordination of the response.
Budget cuts
Laurie Garrett, a Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, expresses concern about the funding needed to contain the virus.
She says budget cuts may have diminished the capacity of the World Health Organization (WHO), one of the leading institutions involved in the emergency response.
"Let's keep in mind, WHO has been running on a budget deficit," she said. "The World Health Assembly voted in their last session to cut the emergency epidemic response capacity of WHO. And if it weren't for the announcement from the World Bank that it will put $200 million into the effort, we basically would have an effort on the ground in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia funded on fumes, volunteer donations, and, you know, a few hundred people who are being unpaid to risk their lives in the middle of this outbreak."
Learning from experience
Garrett says there should be a strategic plan that makes clear the chain of command in the relief effort. The plan would also take into consideration past failures in global health emergencies, including the swine flu in 2009. Though the virus developed in the U.S., Mexico was hit hard. Garrett says Mexico received little international support by being open about the problem.
"Mexico followed all the rules of the game. They told the whole world, 'We have it.' They were completely transparent and open," she said. "They tried to bring it under control, and the response of the international community was, 'Woah, shut the borders to Mexico. Don't let any Mexican planes land anywhere. Penalize Mexico for having this outbreak.' That sent a message to the whole world, 'Wow, don't comply with regulations. Don't try and be a good global citizen in an outbreak because the rest of the world is going to really not be kind to you for doing so.'"
A more appropriate solution, she says, would have been a strategy that includes coordinated government responses to such emergencies. Today, many states have ad hoc plans that often contradict each other.
John Campbell, a Ralph Bunche Senior Fellow for Africa Policy Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and also a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, says countries could begin to devise protocols under the aegis of Africa’s regional organizations, such as the African Union or ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States.
Politics and management
Good governance also comes into play in managing the crisis.
Campbell says one government that has responded well is Lagos State in Nigeria. When a man infected with Ebola arrived in the commercial capital, Lagos (the city), officials began tracing everyone he’d come in contact with - and quarantining him.
"In Lagos [State], a highly effective governor has been succeeded by another highly effective governor. And something approaching a social contract in Lagos is now emerging, a social contract in which people pay taxes and hold their governments accountable for providing services," he said. "Again, when you're talking about a city of 22 million people and with the porosity of boundaries and the movement of people, it's quite possible that even the authorities in Lagos will be overwhelmed. I certainly hope not, and it hasn't happened yet."
Challenges
But, Campbell warns that there’s real potential in urban areas for the rapid spread of the virus. Slums are packed with people, compared to rural areas, where there’s less density. Urban migrants may all speak dialects or languages from their region, which also makes education campaigns more difficult. Proposed solutions include involving in information campaigns influence-makers, including religious leaders.
Not all religious leaders -- or populations -- are amenable to Western health interventions. In northern Nigeria, polio vaccinators have been killed, and today, the area is the site of fighting between the military and Boko Haram militants who reject Western education and medicine.
As with others in West Africa, some northerners deny the existence of Ebola. Or, they say health workers are infecting them the disease or with sterilizing medicines.
"A huge unknown for us right now is how Boko Haram sees itself in the context of, you know, sort of global mobilized health campaigns and whether -- if there were Ebola in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram would be as obstructive as many are now being on the ground in Sierra Leone and Liberia," Laurie Garrett said.
Both senior fellows stress says it’s imperative for the international community to develop a comprehensive strategy for controlling emergency outbreaks, like Ebola. Campbell says there are plenty of diseases in Africa that can turn into pandemics.
When Ebola burns itself out, he says, there’s a good chance it will be replaced with something else.

Sierra Leone Launches New Initiative to Stop Ebola Spread
FREETOWN —
The Sierra Leone government has launched a new initiative to help stop the spread of the Ebola virus. Twenty-five government hospitals will soon have infection and prevention control (IPC) units - the first of their kind in the country.
Seventy-five healthcare workers from across the country are taking part in the two week training, which includes classroom theory and hands on training.
They are learning more about IPC which includes good hand washing practices and wearing proper PPE - personal protective equipment - when coming in contact with a suspected Ebola patient.
Not only will having more IPC units protect patients better but healthcare workers as well. Several international partners are supporting the initiative
“The WHO [World Health Organization] and CDC [Centers for Disease Control] are just helping us and providing the technical support, for example they are paying the tutors from Africa, [Infection Control AfricanNetwork] to come and educate our staff," explained Nanah Sesay - Kamara - national IPC focal person at the Ministry of Health and Sanitation.
"Even in terms of the office they are providing computers, but they plan to help us just for 12 months then we should be able to do this ourselves," she added.
Since the Ebola outbreak began last year, more than 3,500 people have died from the virus in Sierra Leone.
The number of new infections had been on the decline. But with a recent spike of Ebola cases in the country, the IPC timing is crucial to ensure better timely screening, says Dr. Stacey Mearns, health coordinator for the International Rescue Committee, (IRC).
“I think this project is going to play a vital role. Without this project, it will be nearly impossible to get to zero cases, because health facilities will not remain safe and they will remain an ongoing source of transmission," Mearns said.
The IRC is another partner supporting the ministry and is bringing in nurse mentors from Kenya and Canada to work with health staff. Mearns says the IPC concept will also make a difference in the prevention of other diseases spreading.
“As we continue with Ebola response having strong IPC in hospitals will be critical to getting to zero cases. But also this will set the foundation for creating a much safer health system beyond Ebola and will have far reaching impacts for cholera and many other transmissible diseases we have here," Mearns said.
Amy Kolwaite, a nurse epidemiologist with the CDC, explained how trainees can help spread the message.
“They can go back to their hospitals and train - not only nurses but the cleaners, the porters, the kitchen staff, the physicians, train all staff at the hospital to not only protect themselves but protect their patients and their families," she said.
Two more sets of training will take place over the course of this year. The hope is to have similar measures in the two other mainly Ebola affected countries Guinea and Liberia.

Insurgency, Corruption Challenge Jonathan in Nigerian Reelection Bid
To say it hasn’t been an easy four years for Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan would be an understatement.
Endemic corruption, an economy weighed down by sinking oil prices and, most of all, the brutal Boko Haram insurgency may turn out to be millstones that prevent him from being reelected on March 28.
The government's struggle to end the militants' nearly six-year insurgency in particular has fueled opposition to Jonathan and raised the prospects for his main challenger, former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari.
Nigerian forces backed by troops from Chad, Niger, Cameroon and a small number of private foreign private mercenaries have recently retaken many areas formerly held by Boko Haram. But it is not clear what effect that will have at the polls.
The violence in the northeast has killed thousands of people since 2009 and displaced more than a million from their homes, including 150,000 who fled to neighboring countries.
North versus south
Nigeria’s north has never been a stronghold for Jonathan since he took office in May 2010, after the death of President Umaru Yar'adua.
Yar’adua was a Muslim, like most people in the north, while Jonathan is a Christian southerner. The switch upset northern Muslims who felt that, under an informal understanding among national political leaders, it was "their turn" to hold the presidency in a country sharply divided by religion.
Jonathan upset more northerners when he decided to run for a full term in the 2011 election. He defeated Buhari in that poll, spurred on by strong support in the south. Allegations of vote rigging sparked sectarian-fueled violence in the north that killed about 800 people.
The Jonathan administration has enjoyed some major successes, such when an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Lagos was quickly contained last year. The southern Niger Delta region — home to the country’s massive oil reserves — has remained quiet under his watch, after Yar'adua gave amnesty to militants who were attacking the vital oil industry.
Despite the violence in the northeast, the ruling People's Democratic Party last year renominated Jonathan as its presidential candidate.
If the 57-year-old wins reelection, he will have to contend with a major funding shortfall for Africa's leading crude oil producer. The worldwide slump in oil prices has cut government revenues deeply.
Rebels remain chief issue
Boko Haram, however, is likely to remain the primary problem. Analysts predict that even if the military succeeds in retaking all areas captured by the group, suicide bombings and raids on small towns will continue.
Jonathan also has drawn criticism, at home and abroad, for not doing more to locate more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram last April. The Nigerian military says it has found no clues to the girls' whereabouts as troops recapture the militants' former strongholds.

Study: Ebola Vaccine May Fall Short
One of the Ebola vaccines about to enter testing in Liberia may not be as potent as researchers had hoped, according to a new study, raising questions about how well it will prevent infection.
The vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline, is one of two in a large-scale clinical trial expected to begin in the next two weeks. Merck produced the other vaccine.
Earlier studies had found that one dose of the GSK vaccine would protect monkeys from Ebola.
However, in the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, “What we see are immune responses that are several-fold lower than were seen in those monkey studies,” said study co-author Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford.
“That raises the question, will it work as well in people as in monkeys? The short answer is we don’t know,” he added, “but that’s exactly the question the trials in Liberia and elsewhere are designed to address.”
The trial in Liberia will use a higher dose of the vaccine. A study of a related vaccine published in November found patients given a higher dose developed a stronger immune response. Monkeys with a comparable response were protected from infection.
The Merck vaccine has been undergoing early tests as well, but data from those studies have not been published.
Researchers are moving at record speed to develop a vaccine in response to the unprecedented Ebola outbreak centered in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. More than 22,000 people have been infected and nearly 9,000 have died.
The declining number of new infections is good news for health workers, but may make it more difficult to determine the effectiveness of a vaccine.

WHO: Ebola Threatens States, Societies in W. Africa
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says Ebola poses a threat to the governments and societies of West Africa.
Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO, said Monday that she has "never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure."
In a statement to a health conference in the Phillippines, Chan warned the number of cases is "rising exponentially" in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and said the outbreak shows how the world is ill-prepared for a severe and sustained public health emergency.
Other U.N. officials, including U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, have sounded similar warnings about the Ebola epidemic, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa.
Defying calls for a strike
Chan spke as most health workers in Liberia reported to work Monday, ignoring calls for a strike that could have weakened efforts to fight the Ebola epidemic.
The country's Health Workers Association had told members to stay home unless they received higher hazard pay promised by the Liberian government. But hospitals and health officials say the majority of nurses and physician's assistants came to work, and medical facilities were operating.
The secretary-general of the union, George Williams, accused the government of pressuring workers to defy the strike.
In an interview with VOA, Liberia's assistant health minister, Tolbert Nyensuah, said the government can't meet all the health workers' demands because it needs to keep opening Ebola treatment centers.
"So it's negotiation," he said. "And we understand that their leadership have understood this. We have to put all of our differences aside. Unite. Come together as a country. Solve this problem and then we can continue to discuss those issues."
Confirmed Cases of Ebola in West Africa
Alphonsus Wiah, a hygienist with the Island Clinic Ebola Treatment Unit, the largest government-run Ebola center in the capital, Monrovia, said the workers were demanding $700 in monthly hazard pay on top of their monthly salaries of $200 to $300.
"This [Ebola] epidemic is not just a normal hospital disease," Wiah said. "... As I speak to you, some of our colleagues, the health workers, are dying. So, our demand was the salary structure that [the] government offered was too low, and we believe there should be an increment in the salary structure."
Workers also have complained about a lack of protective gear.
The extra money promised to workers is being paid, Reuters news service quoted Health Minister Walter Swenigale as saying.
Liberia has endured the largest number of Ebola infections of any country, according to the World Health Organization, with 4,076 confirmed cases as of October 8. The virus has killed at least 2,316, including 95 health workers out of 201 infected. The regional outbreak had infected almost 8,400 people and killed more than 4,000.

​Government position
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf reportedly toured Ebola treatment units around Monrovia Saturday and asked health workers to remain on the job, according to assistant health minister Tolbert Nyenswah.
Health Minister Walter Gweningale referred VOA to Minister of Information Lewis Brown for comment. Brown has not responded to VOA's requests for comment for the past week.
Health workers
Wiah said that although the health workers took an oath to save lives, they need protection from Ebola while making a living.
He said that when the first Ebola cases were confirmed in Guinea in March, the government agreed to pay $700 a month for hazard pay. But, Wiah said, the government soon changed its mind and reduced the monthly allowance.
"We projected, according government’s first announcement, that doctors will make $1,500. Nurses will make $750, plus their government salary, then hygienists will make $750," Wiah said.
"Later on, it came to as low as 250 US dollars. So, we are saying the $250 is very small, and those that go in the ETUs [Ebola treatment units] $300 is also very small."
Vaccine clinical trials begin
Meanwhile, the Public Health Agency of Canada said Monday that phase one clinical trials for an experimental Ebola vaccine have begun.
It says the vaccine has shown great promise in animal research and will be tested at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the U.S. state of Maryland.

Survivors Strive for Ebola-Free Sierra Leone
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE —
Sierra Leone is working hard to get down to zero cases of Ebola. Survivors are playing a key role, helping raise awareness about the disease by going out into communities every day to educate people.
Moa Wharf, an impoverished area of Freetown, was recently a hot spot for the Ebola virus. That's why Ebola survivors like Sulaiman Watfa are key. He and other Ebola survivors are immune to the disease and have been educating Moa Wharf residents about the virus.
At first, it wasn’t easy, he said in his native Krio dialect. “When I went into quarantine homes, they would say, 'No, don’t talk to me,' but then I show them my Ebola survivor certificate and they realize I can help, and they listen to me,” he said.
Watfa lost almost his entire family to Ebola. He contracted it from his father. And although Watfa survived, life hasn’t been easy. He’s faced a lot of stigma. No one will hire him when they hear he is an Ebola survivor.
The work he has been doing, however, seems to make a difference. Moa Wharf has been Ebola-free now for more than 21 days. That number is significant, because that is the virus' incubation time.
UNICEF is one of the nongovernmental organizations supporting the community of Moa Wharf through social mobilization, said Lucy Knight, a communications for development specialist with UNICEF.
“We identified that survivors were going to be very important in this community," she said. "It’s marginalized, it’s a slum, it’s on the coastline of Freetown. The quarantined homes were hard to get to, and there wasn’t always room for security people to be there all the time.”
Fatmata Bangura’s home was one of three quarantined in an area of the community after a man died from Ebola there. Approximately 60 people live in the three homes.
Speaking in Krio, Bangura said she was grateful for the work of Ebola survivors. “They come talk to us, and we really appreciate it,” she said.
And while it’s great news that the community is Ebola-free for now, people still need to be alert, Knight said. Three new Ebola cases were reported in Freetown on Wednesday.
“We are seeing from the Moa Wharf cluster, cases in other wards in Freetown," she said.
Almost 4,000 people have died from the virus in Sierra Leone. Watfa said he would continue volunteering until Sierra Leone was Ebola-free.

UN Ebola Response Team Establishing Office in Mali
The United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) is establishing an office in Mali to help support the West African country’s ongoing efforts to combat and contain the Ebola virus, according to Ari Gaitanis, head of the public information unit at the U.N.
Officials say when established, the U.N. Office will reinforce Mali’s operational response by strengthening the West African nation’s level of preparedness and assisting with cross-border coordination of Ebola efforts between Malian and Guinean authorities.
Gaitanis said the decision to establish an office in Mali came after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon held a conversation with Mali’s President, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta.
“The secretary-general announced the World Health Organization’s top official in the country to head the UNMEER office in Mali,” said Gaitanis. “We are also evaluating and studying what kind of presence we need, how many staff, what kind of resources required, and that’s all in motion from the day it was announced.”
This also followed a visit to Mali by Anthony Banbury, the secretary-general's special representative and head of UNMEER who met both local and international partners involved in response to combat Ebola.
“He met the president of Mali and they discussed the possibility of UNMEER, the U.N. mission, having some sort of presence in the country to help support the country’s Ebola response effort,” said Gaitanis.
The World Health Organization on Friday released the latest update on the death toll in the Ebola epidemic, which it said has risen to 5,459 out of 15,351 cases identified in eight countries by the end of November 18.
Countries in West African currently battling the Ebola outbreak include Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Mali, recently recorded its cases, which officials say are small in number compared to the outbreak of the disease in neighboring countries.
Gaitanis said lessons learned from the countries battling to contain the disease could go a long way in helping Mali to prevent an outbreak.
“UNMEER has lessons learned of course and has experience already in this sort of crisis response. And the fact is that Mali now has a small number of cases compared to others and this means that there is a chance of ending it quickly before it becomes a true crisis, the way it has become in other countries,” said Gaitanis.
